Prologue

Let me begin by stating that I am not a writera conclusion youd have arrived at on your own soon enough. I know no tricks of narrative nor do I have an extensive vocabulary, but I do know an editor (wink). I once lost a spelling bee trying to spell vakation. Writing isnt my thing. Policing is. But when Norrah and I debated which of us should put this thing into words, her persistency in it being me won her the day. We havent put much thought into what might become of these pages, if anything, but we both agreed the events of late needed to be put on paper, and well let fate or destiny take it from there. I should add that I have spoken with a couple others, and they agreed to write some things regarding this ordeal as well. To what extent Im unsure of at this moment. So it looks like this is going to be a collective effort. I have the honor of leading off. And probably wrapping it up.
You probably dont know me, so let me introduce myself as Jay Davis. Having been in the Marines before becoming a cop, I have long been accustomed to being called Davis, not Jay. Cops and military folks insist on calling people by their surnames, and Id love to know why. For a while they were calling me J.D., but it didnt stick, didnt grow legs. Norrah calls me Jay unless shes feeling particularly feisty or when Ive gotten into some kind of shit. 
If within the last year youve watched the news or listened to the radio, or have friends to chew the shit with about current events, you know who my girlfriend Norrah is. Norrah Petersen with an E, shes Danish. Shes the one whos given interview after interview on any number of news channels, news magazines, newspapers. Id bet dollars to donuts that most of you have made up your minds that Norrah is a lunatic. Or insaneIm not sure if the two are the same thing. How could someone so sane-looking and pretty be so batty? I can tell you sincerely that she is completely sane, and has never told a lie that I know of. Everything youve heard her say is the truth. What was alleged to have happened at her house indeed happened. I was there that day, was one of the first cops to arrive on scene. That was the day I met Norrah. It was that first week of the news-frenzy that Norrah and I began dating. Well, I say dating but it wasnt dating. As you can imagine dating wasnt something she was suitable to engage herself in during that time, but we were something. Come to think of it, maybe we were nothing more than new friends, but we had a kind of intuition that hinted that we had found someone more than a friend, it just needed time to blossom, and blossom it did. Did I mention that Im not a writer? I apologize in advance for running off on various tangents during the narrative, I dont know any better. Im also ruthlessly apologetic. I learned that trick back when I was a teenager working some customer service gig at Sears: apologize and apologize often, it works. 
I suppose I should start at the beginning and assume you have no knowledge of Norrah and the shit that happened last year. Some of the details I learned second-hand from Norrah, so keep that in mind as youre reading personal details of her history and recent experiences, as I wasnt a part of her life until the day that the twenty-three people went missing. Funny thing about that, the number twenty-three almost begs to have the word the before it. Without the its just a number; with it becomes the greatest unsolved mystery of our generation. The twenty-three who went missing.
Lake Arrowhead is a mountain town of ten-thousand or so people, located in the San Bernardino mountains in southern California. The elevation is around five-thousand feet, and it snows a few months out of the year. People unfamiliar to this region might find it hard to believe that folks shovel snow a few months out of the year right here in southern California. But it does snow, and it was snowing on that fateful February 14th, Valentines Day. And on top of that, it had been colder than a whores heart for the week leading up to it. Being a cop I see a lot more work when its sub-freezing, as a lot of dumbasses drive the speed limit on roads with black ice, and I inevitably wind up having to fill out paperwork because of it. Fun fact: there are ten times more fender benders up here in the winter than there are in the summer. Ten times!
Norrahs house isnt on the lake, but she has a great view of it. Its a grand old three-story house at the end of a cul-de-sac, no neighbors too near, fairly remote, and its great if privacy is your thing. No houses behind her for a quarter mile, just untamed pines and underbrush and a steep hillside rolling away from it and eventually into the deep-blue lake. 
From the driveway you enter the second floorthe bottom floor can almost be termed a basement. Being that the home is on a hillside, the front of the bottom floor is underground while the back isnt and has windows affording a view of the lake, and even has remote access. The top story is Norrahs bedroom, a pair of guest bedrooms, and a bathroom. The second floor is a large living room with its back wall a series of large windowpanes, a deck where you can sit and sip wine while admiring the beauty of Lake Arrowhead. Norrah could suntan on that deck naked with no chance of being seen, other than by me. I keep trying to get her to do just that because shes both pasty and looks marvelous naked. Im sure Norrah will just love to know I wrote that.
Let me give you a brief history of how Norrah came to live in this house and why Paul was a tenant thereinPaul Klein is another name youve been inundated with on the news. The house was bought by Norrahs grandparents Jack and Dolores back in the 80s, a kind of retirement home. When her grandpa passed away ten years ago it was too much house for just her grandmother (2,600 square feet). Norrahs parents had been living in Denver by then and had no interest in moving back to southern Cal. So when Dolores decided to move into an old-folks community, she let Norrah live there. The house isnt quite paid off yet, but it was bought at a time that real estate was laughably cheap, a mortgage of under a grand, so it was a sweet deal for Norrah. When Dolores dies, the house will become her granddaughter Norrahs. 
When Norrah first moved in she was working at the only grocery store in Lake Arrowhead, Stater Brotherstheres a Jansens Market as well, but its small. She rang up groceries. Shes thirty now, so that would make her around twenty at the time. After so many years of being a checker I guess she came to the grim realization that if she didnt get an education shed be doing that shit for the rest of her life. Six years ago she began taking night classes at a community college down the mountain in Yucaipa, about a forty minute drive from her house. Only taking two classes at a time, it would take her nine or ten years to get that vaunted bachelors degree, and as I write this she is still a couple years away from attaining that goal. Because she was taking classes she worked less hours, though not much less. Her expenditures were higher because of the insane prices at the gas pump, tuition and books. She lived alone in a large house, so it seemed like a good idea to find a roommate to share the expenses with. The house is ideal for such an arrangement, being that the bottom floor can be accessed without stepping foot into Norrahs living area. It is somewhat of a basement, though I dont know of too many basements in which there is remote access; keep in mind houses up on the mountain are on slopes, so while the bottom floor is underground at the front of the house, they are typically above ground in the backdid I mention that already? There is a hatch that can be lowered over the portal of the stairs leading down to the bottom floor, and when Paul moved in she did just that. It gave the faade of the bottom floor being an apartment, separate from the upper stories. There is a bathroom down there, but no kitchenette. Just a hot-plate and a microwave on a dresser, a little mini-fridge. The bottom floor is a studio apartment; the only door other than the backdoor is that of the bathroom. Norrah charged him four-hundred a month, just under half her mortgage payment. He had been living there for three months when the event this story is engendered from took place. 
I judge Paul Klein to be about twenty or twenty-one years old (I cant say that with any degree of certainty). When he interviewed with Norrah to take residency in her house, he said he was going to college at the University of Redlands, or U of R. That was a lie. He also said he was working part-time at Papagayos, a Mexican restaurant. That was also a lie. Turns out much of what Paul said was bullshit. Paul is a big mystery in most aspects. Hes a good looking kid, the kind of smile that girls are eager to revisit, the kind of charming witticisms that make girls giggle, and exceedingly well-spoken for a kid so young. The damned thing about Paul Klein is that when detectives began investigating his history following the disappearance of the twenty-three, they found nothing. Not jack shit. It was as though he didnt exist prior to moving into Norrahs. And other than the registration and insurance papers on his Dodge Ram, and his Wells Fargo bank account, there are no records of his existence, not even a social security number. Being that he wasnt a suspect of foul play against the missing people (Ill elaborate on that later), he got by without having to prove much of his past. I dont like Paul, disliked him from the moment I met him, and cant put a finger on why exactly that is. Maybe its because his smile looks phony to me. Something doesnt jibe with him. Im not the only one who feels that way about him, though most dont. Most gobble up his bullshit wholesale. Norrah didnt feel the same way about him or she wouldnt have let him in her house, but I suspect she was lured in by his good looks, though she wont admit it. When I pester her about it she blushes and changes the subject, so you be the judge.
February 14th was the day it happened. By February 15th Lake Arrowhead was a town that most Americans were knowledgeable of. By February 21st a respectable percentage of the world had heard of Lake Arrowhead. The largest unsolved mystery of all time, many people say. I was patrolling highway 18 when I got the call from dispatch. Never when dispatch calls do you think this is the time that everything changes, that this call is the one that youre going to be writing a fucking book about. I took the call indifferently, how was I to know? I was the second officer to arrive; Fred Guthrie the fat ass had just pulled up when I got there. An hour later every cop on the mountain was there. Twenty-three people gone missing under highly unusual circumstances will do that. The F.B.I. didnt arrive till the next day, as people arent considered to be missing until twenty-four hours have passed. Instead of telling you what we found (or didnt find), Im going to recite Norrahs story for you, a story which shes told me time and time again. I will make no exaggerations whatsoever and will confer with her often as I write the particulars. I honestly wish shed write this shit. But Ive come to love her, and there is little I wouldnt do for her. So here it goes:

Part 1:
Chapter One

A man with red skin, horns, and a tail walks into a pub on Halloween, sits at the bar. Impressed, the bartender whistles and says, You take your costuming serious, huh?
I do, the man replies.
Well its a special occasion, so why not, eh?
 It is. Its the only day all year I dont have to wear one.

The weather forecasters had gotten it all wrong, as they often do. I swear, it could be twenty-one degrees out and theyll predict a low of thirty-three. Or they will say eighty percent chance of snow when if they stuck their damned heads outside theyd see that its already snowing. I digress. The storm that was due to arrive on Monday night, February 15th, had arrived Saturday night, the evening before Valentines Day. Two feet of snow dumped on the mountain like Jack Frost took a massive icy shit, blanketing the San Bernardino forest with holy whiteness. Cal Trans is great at clearing the roads, and come Sunday morning, cars didnt need chains to traverse the winding mountain roads. That Valentines Day morning Norrah was getting ready for work at Stater Brothers when her bottom-floor tenant Paul Klein lifted the hatch and entered the living room. It wasnt off-limits to him to be above the basement floor, but it was understood that his place was down there and her place was up there, and there was little-to-no need for him to come up. Occasionally he did come up, but always with a good reasonto pay rent (always on time), to offer to chop some of the logs flanking the side of the house into firewood, to drop off a couple bottles of red wine his friend got for free from work (sample bottles from a wine rep), and the last and most consequential occurrence of his upstairs intrusion was on the morning of Valentines Day.
Norrah had just shut off the blow-dryer in her third-floor bathroom when she heard Paul holler, Hello-hello! 
Norrah cinched her robes belt and took a couple steps down the top flight of stairs. Hi, Paul, she said with her charming smileshe really is a cute little devil, and that smile makes me fall in love with her all over again every time I see it.
Morning, Norrah. I was hoping we could talk for a few minutes. I know youre leaving for work soon, but its kind of important.
Uh okay. 
She went downstairs and took a seat at the dining room table. Paul sat opposite her. He wore black slacks and a dark blue golf shirt. His black hair was slightly wavy and always looked wet. He looked like he belonged in any number of teen-heartthrob movies. It was easy to smile at him, easy to get a little lost in his hazel eyes. Hes the kind of guy that you find yourself telling too-personal things to in hope that hell reciprocate a juicy nugget of his own. She felt uncomfortable wearing nothing but a bath robe, just a little tug on her cloth-belt away from being nude before this good looking boy, but it wasnt by her design: he came up to see her. She crossed her legs under the table and asked how he was doing.
Great, thank you. Ill make this quick, since you have to leave here in, he checked his wristwatch, what, fifteen minutes? She nodded. I have a huge favor to ask you. I know I said I wasnt going to have many people over, and I respect your wish of quietude herequietude, who the hell says quietude?but somethings come up. There are some guys I go to school with, and every year on Valentines Day theres a party. A masquerade party. It was going to be at Taylors house this year; he lives just a few miles from here. Something came up and the place is a no-go. We all had our hearts set on having the party up in the mountains; you know cozy snow, roaring fire, forest; and being that your house is so near Taylors, it seemed like a good logistical alternative. So I
How many people are we talking?
Not many. I believe something like eight guys and their dates. Maybe a couple others, but I dont know for sure. Theyre all students of University of Redlands, good considerate guys and girls. I trust them all. We wont be rowdy, you have my word.
From what time till what time?
Paul looked up and away, considered it. Eight till about one or two in the morning. Well have the music turned down by midnight.
I suppose it would be all right, if its a one-time thing. Dont get in the habit of having get-togethers here. Its not that I dont trust
Paul held up a hand to stop her, grinned sidelong, and said, No need to say it. I havent been here long, I dont expect you to trust me. But well keep the party downstairs, so there wont be any reason to worry about things breaking or stuff getting stolen. And being that the nearest house is what, fifty yards away or better?I doubt anyone will know were here other than you.
All right, Norrah said, it should be fine. I work the early shift tomorrow so Ill be in bed by eleven. If you could keep it down at around that time Id appreciate it. I sleep on the third floor, but can still hear music from down below. Do that for me and we have a deal.
Awesome.
One other thing. Would you mind parking your truck on the street or farther to the right on the driveway from now on? Its a big truck, not a big driveway.
Consider it done. Paul stood and extended his hand. She shook it with a smile and left the table, went upstairs to dress.
Early that evening Norrah was driving home from work when it began snowing again. Just a light snow, more of an afterword to the storm that landed last night. She parked her Camry on the driveway beside an Infinity sedan she had never before seen, in the place of Pauls usual Dodge truck. She wondered if he traded it in. She went inside and locked the door behind her. Paul must have heard her arrive because he went upstairs through the open hatch shortly after. He was dressed in black slacks and a white dress-shirt with a red bow-tie. Was he really going to wear a tux tonight? She wondered. He asked if she had any scotch tape he could borrow, and some tacks and a hammer. She had tape and a hammer but no tacks, sorry. He thanked her and waited for her to collect the two items. When she handed them over he said, You should come hang out with us tonight, if youd like.
Her brow arched. Me? She considered it was more of a polite gesture than an honest invitation. She was thirty, while he presumably wasnt old enough to buy booze yet. But maybe he was. He possessed that youthful appearance that lasts a lifetime, like Dick Clark had. She considered herself to be a young-looking thirty, and guys did check her out when she was checking them out (groceries, that is) but still they were college kids and if the others looked anything like Paul Klein, they could do a lot better than Norrahher words, not mine; if you ask me, Norrah is the best any man could do. Thanks, but I dont think that would be a good idea.
Suit yourself, but youre welcome to join us. He turned and took a couple steps down the stairs through the portal while adding, Might be a single guy or two. Theyd be all over you.
Wait, she said after him. He stopped and looked back; only his shoulders and head remained above the landing. What do you mean by that?
Oh I dont mean anything like that. Im sorry, that sounded suggestive. I just mean youre an attractive woman and theyd appreciate it. Thats all.
She nodded slightly. Thats sweet of you to say, but I dont believe that. You guys be safe down there. You have my cell phone number, so call or text if you need anything and Ill bring it down.
Sweet. Youre the best, Norrah.
She grinned and went upstairs to change into some lounge-wear. Sweats and a sweat-shirt, her most comfy socks, and tied her hair into a pony-tail. She nuked some Lean Pockets in the microwave and poured some iced tea, mulling over the idea of a masquerade party. It was intriguing, a masquerade party. And on Valentines Day, of all days. Werent those kinds of things only on Halloween? She wondered if theyd be wearing costumes or just a mask. Every instance of masquerading she had heard of or read about was mostly just a mask. She remembered watching The Count of Monte Cristo, and there was the carnival at Rome, taking place sometime in the early 19th century, and those people had those little masks that were attached to a stick and held up against their faces. She supposed some of them were fastened to their heads by a string going over their ears and tied at the back. They were partial masks, covering the forehead and nose but not the mouth. She doubted this was the type of masquerading her tenant had in mind, but who knows? In her memory of the carnival of that movie the people were classy, dressed formally, and it was a regal occasion, a big deal. Could college kids put together something so tasteful? It seemed more likely they would wear costumes. She could see in her imagination a girl dressed as Elvira, tits popping out of her low vee-cut shirt, and another girl with a less desirable figure dressed as Snow White or Cinderella, the fabric at the waist threatening to bust at the seams. She pictured a college boy wearing a Spiderman mask. Peter Parker. Maybe hed try to get a chuckle out of the dames by calling himself his porn-acting name Peter Pork-her. Perhaps a muscular boy would flaunt his rippling beefcake by going shirtless and painting his torso green, and pretend to be the Incredible Hulk. The more she considered the possibilities, the more curious she became about this party. 
Norrah remembered her sleep mask. One of those black deals that sleepers wear when they are forced to contend with an unchecked morning sun. She had been one such sleeper at a younger age, but had since gotten blinds put up over her window and put to rest the use of a sleeping mask. What if she cut holes into the eyes and wore that down to her tenants party? Nah, thats ridiculous. That isnt any kind of disguise. And besides, what would she wear with it? 
She sat at the dining table and bit into the first of two Lean Pockets. It was the pizza flavored one. She preferred the mozzarella and meatballs ones but for some damned reason those made her gassy; the remarkably similar pizza ones didnt. Go figure. She looked out the glass wall into the forest that Jack Frost had shit all over. It was getting dark, the sun long invisible below the wooden horizon. The trees would stay white until the temperature finally got above freezing. The flood light of her back second-floor deck was on a timer and just then clicked on. Large snowflakes feathered down to a carpet of snow specked with what looked like diamond dust. She was nearly two months removed from songs of walking in a winter wonderland, but only two yards away from literally doing it.
Car doors closed somewhere out front. 
Norrah hated that she was officially in her thirties now, had been for months. As stupid as it sounded, if she was still twenty-nine shed strongly consider making an appearance downstairs sometime tonight. But being thirty changed things, if only internally. Thirties were the years for settling down and pumping out babies; twenties were the years for preventing babies from being born by any number of contraceptives and ancient family secretshop up and down if the jackass doesnt pull out in time. Ones twenties are a string of bad-judgment calls and too many colorful cocktails with cherries skewered on toothpicks, driving the back-roads at two AM and waking up with a massive headache and a sensation of bodily violation that you may or may not have any recollection of. Those were the years when pleasure took a front seat to everything; these were the years that pleasure took a back seat to anything practical and well considered.
There was a knock at the door, then the doorbell.
Norrah left the table and went to the door, looked through the peep-hole. A boy and girl. She smiled at what she saw: half-masks not unlike the ones worn in The Count of Monte Cristo. The girl wore a deep red dress, long and formal, with a black cat mask, whiskers and stubby nose. Her hair was ash blonde and professionally styled, like something youd see Nichole Kidman sporting at the Oscars. The boy wore a tuxedo. His mask was a lions face, complete with tawny fur and ears. She could see both their smiling mouths. She didnt hesitate to open the door. Just as she greeted them, Paul came up from behind and apologized, said he told everyone to enter through the downstairs back door.
Its okay, Norrah assured, I dont mind. She smiled wider at the two guests. Cute masks.
Thanks, the boy said. Im sorry, I totally forgot that we were supposed to go around back.
Sorry, the girl said in a high tone.
It shouldnt happen again, Paul said to Norrah, then gestured the two to follow him.
Norrah closed the door and locked it, followed after the trio. Is everyone going to wear masks like that?
Paul looked back with his patent crooked smile and said, You bet. The offer stands, if you want to join us. Free drinks.
Are you all old enough to drink? She regretted saying it immediately. It made her feel older than she was ready to be. She frowned and said, Dont answer that. Im sorry.
He didnt answer that, but instead winked at her. The three went downstairs.
Over the next hour Norrah heard the downstairs door open and close several times, a few car doors slamming shut in the street. She decided to upgrade from sweats to something less comfortable; put on a cute little black skirt and pink cardigan sweater. Not that she intended for anyone else to see her tonight, but she hadnt intended for the first couple to see her either, and we know how that turned out. And didnt Paul mention that there would be one or two single guys here tonight? Yes, he had. 
She was debating herself by eight oclock, the time Paul had said the party would start. Stay up here and dont interfere narrowly edged out go downstairs and mingle. She was seated before the blue glow of the television, watching some old comedy movie whose name escaped her. She wasnt paying attention to the movie, but to the sounds downstairs, the joyful sounds. She poured herself a glass of red wine in the kitchen, a bottle that Paul had given her recently for no particular reason, and returned to the couch, folded her legs to the side the way only a woman can, and tucked a hanging ribbon of brown hair behind an ear.
Norrah sighed. She remembered being in high school like it was yesterday. There were plenty of parties back then, you bet. Some during her junior year, but most were when she was a senior. There had been no masquerade parties, though. Her dumb classmates couldnt conceive of such a neat idea as that. They were masquerading as good virtuous boys, thats about it. She had let one of them inside her pants at one party. That would be a bad-judgment-call evening. She chalked it up to too many margaritas. What was the boys name? She couldnt remember. Oh yes, Elias. What a cutie he was. Small wiener, though. She giggled just as she sipped her wine and nearly spilled on her pink cardigan. That was her only one-night-stand in her thirty semi-uneventful years. The boy she lost her virginity to was Gregwho she always called Gregory, despite his protestationswhen she was a lithe seventeen years old, beauty in full bore, breasts that stayed in place when she unhooked her bra. Not that they sagged much now, but lets be honest: boobs are at their prime during their teenaged years. Their sun begins setting in the twenties slowly but surely. Gregory sure liked her boobs. He used to offer to massage them, as if it was intended to be a benefit to her and not him. She went along with it, loved to see how excited it made him. And it did things to her, too, just not to the extent that it did to him. Its a shame that when her body was hard and rocking she was a dozen or so years from reaching her sexual prime. How unfair is that? Boys are in their sexual prime as teens, but for women it comes much later. By the time women want sex frequently, that ship has long sailed in men. Why couldnt both sexual primes meet at the same age? She wondered if all the hormones downstairs had an infectious effect on her, like she was a cat in heat and picked up on the scent of a dominant male.
Maybe I should just drop by for a minute or two, introduce myself to Pauls friends, then come right back up, she thought. Heck, she was looking pretty good in this sweater and skirt, if she did say so herself. There was the sleeping mask in the bottom drawer of her bureau, she hadnt forgotten that. She was indecisive. She resolved to make a decision, but not until she bellied one more glass of red, and got to work doing just that.
It was 8:45 when she was nearing the bottom of her wine-glass. She felt the alcohol high on her cheeks. She wasnt much of a drinker, so she appreciated a good buzz. She had heard the music downstairs marginally loud for over an hour now, and had to turn the TV up to contend with it. Progressively what she heard more and more wasnt the stereo but the laughter of teens and twenty-somethings. As more alcohol was consumed, the laughter got louder and lasted longer. She heard one boy laugh so regularly that she began imagining what he looked like. She pictured a six-foot-two baseball player, trim but hard and strong, with sandy blond hair, fine golden hairs on his toned arms. She even ascribed a mask to him: a pirate. Aaarg, ahoy matey! Hed want to plunder some booty, all right. 
With a smile she stood from the couch and sauntered to the window-wall, opened the door and slid into her slippers that she kept beside it, crunched snow to the railing. She took the last drink from her glass looking down over the rail. Just then the door opened down below and a boy stepped outside. She couldnt yet see him, but soon smelled cigarette smoke. She was silent and as still as a statue, the large flakes collecting in her hairit wasnt coming down very hard, but the flakes were enormouscontinued looking down to where the bottom deck ended and sloped down to rugged forest. She felt fortunate to not have any neighbors in her backyard. There was a street closer to the lake with houses, but that was hundreds of yards from where she lived. On a whim she gathered some snow and packed a snowball. She leaned over the railing and chucked it at an angle to where she perceived the boy (or girl?) to be smoking. A powdery poof was followed by footfalls away from the house, until a boy entered her view. He was looking up with a wide grin. He wore a tuxedo, a gray mouse mask with a long pointy nose and whiskers. He took a drag from his smoke and waved up at Norrah.
Hi there, she said.
Evening, madam, the boy replied. 
She humored at that. Madam. Maybe his formal attire did wonders to his demeanor, instilled in him a sense of class he might not have had under another circumstance. She got a kick out of it.
Evening, kind sir. Are you enjoying yourself?
A gust of wind grazed her cheek and legs, breaking her flesh out in goose bumps. Her skirt fluttered a little with it, raised high on her thighs, and for a terrifying moment she thought he could see up her skirtthe railing had wide gaps between the posts. She remembered putting underwear on, so that was good; also was the fact that the light was above her, darkness below her. Hed see nothing but shadows up her skirt.
Indeed. I take it this is your house?
Indubitably, she said with a rich British accent, and went to sip her wine that had already been drank.
Looks like you could use a refill, he said.
Perhaps. How many of you are down there?
Uh He looked away from her at the house. Maybe twenty, twenty-five.
What are some of the masqueraders masquerading as?
Why dont you come down and see for yourself? He grinned most charmingly at her.
Maybe, she said noncommittally. Anything especially good?
Mask-wise?
She hummed an affirmative.
Yeah, there are some good ones.
Which is your favorite?
Elephant is pretty cool. Actually, believe it or not, my favorite is the guy with a mask of a person.
Mask of a person?
Its porcelain, I think. Powder white. Very clever, you see, because he has a hat with attached horns. Looks like hes the devil masquerading as a normal man.
That is clever, Norrah agreed. Is he the devil?
I hope not! The boy laughed. I dont know him, though.
I thought you were all classmates. No?
Mostly, yes.
The door opened and another boy stepped outside and asked the smoker if he could bum a smoke. The mouse-man offered his pack of Reds to the boy who was masked as Phantom of the Opera. He stepped into the wash of the upstairs flood light, looked up and startled at Norrahs sight.
Damn, he said. Whats up?
Me, I suppose, she said and grinned.
You should be down. Down here.
Oh yeah? She thought she was sounding like a coquette, and couldnt recall the last time she was flirty with anyone. If I had a good mask I would take you up on that offer, she said regretfully. I guess if one of you boys could masquerade as a normal man I could masquerade as a normal girl.
Normal man? Phantom of the Opera said.
You know, said mouse-man, the dude with a white porcelain man-face.
Oh, him. Who is that guy, anyway?
I dont know. We arent supposed to ask. Thats a rule.
Well Ill let you boys go, Norrah said. Have fun. She stepped away from the railing.
Wait, Phantom said. Wont you come down and have a drink? Im buying.
Youre buying? Arent the drinks free?
No such thing as a free lunch, madam.
Ah. An economics major, huh? She said and giggled.
Hell no, I hate economics. But yeah I learned that in Econ 101. I brought a bottle of gin and some tonic. I got a glass with your name on it down here.
She returned to her spot at the rail and said, Dont you boys have dates already? How would they take you flirting with the old maid upstairs?
Hes got a date, Phantom of the Opera said, but I dont. His non-masked right eye winked at her.
She laughed out loud, by the image, not his words. Well see. What are your names? Im Norrah.
Phantom, Phantom said.
Mouse, the other said. We cant give our names, its the rule.
Okay, Mouse and Phantom. Maybe Ill come down for just one drink in a few minutes.
Right on, Phantom said.
She went inside and closed the door, brushed the snow out of her hair. She shivered. It was south of twenty degrees by her best guess. Hardly skirt weather, but she looked hot in it. She heard a song she recognized coming from the stereo downstairs. It was a Stone Temple Pilots song, Plush, one of her favorite songs from that band. It must have been someone elses favorite song too because the volume was ratcheted up a good deal seconds after it began. 
Deciding against going unmasked, she went upstairs to get the sleep mask. Then downstairs, where she got the scissors from a jar on the counter and got to work cutting eyes out of it. If asked what she was masquerading as, shed say well Sleeping Beauty, of course. Maybe it was the alcohol that made her laugh so hard just then. She put the mask on, pulled her hair out from under the elastic band and draped it over.
The downstairs hatch creaked open. She looked over and saw a boy in a black tux. It was Paul, she decided, though his jester mask served well at disguising him. His strong jaw, slender torso and broad shoulders identified him well enough.
Hey-hey, Norrah, he said as he cleared the landing. I hope you dont mind if I use your restroom. Mine is occupied.
No problem. Theres a guest bathroom just over there, she said and pointed to the restroom off the den.
Thanks. I hope this doesnt offend you, but theres a couple in my bathroom. I think theyll be in there for a little while, if you know what I mean.
She smiled devilishly. Thats fine.
As he made his way toward the bathroom he said, Cool, I see you got a mask going. Coming downstairs for a bit?
Yeah, for a quick drink. Are you sure you dont mind?
Not at all. But if I may make a suggestion
Sure. Please, she said eagerly.
Put some nylons on. Wearing a skirt like that, youll freeze down there. Not to sound ungrateful, but the insulation down there is poor and I dont have a heater.
You should make a fire.
I have a fire going, but it doesnt put out much heat, and the door has been open at least half the time, from people smoking.
Okay, thanks for the heads up. Ill put some nylons on.
I bet youll look hot in them, Paul said, appraising her legs. Not that you need them to make your legs look hot, its just that you have the whitest legs Ive ever seen.
She looked down at her legs. Yeah, thats for sure.
He passed her on the way to the restroom. You have nice legs, Norrah. Very sexy.
She sensed that little remark could potentially change the dynamic of their tenant-landlord relationship, but decided it didnt matter. They were ten years apart, nothing would ever happen between them. 
Norrah went upstairs, got the nylons out of her top drawer and took a seat on the bed. She could still hear the music, though it was faint from up here. Stone Temple Pilots was now Viva La Vida by Coldplay, another song she enjoyed. She was singing along as she rolled the stockings up her long slender legs. Were they really that sexy? Paul seemed to think so and maybe he was right. They were firm, somewhat defined, a long line separating her quad from hamstring. Going for long walks most evenings on the steep mountain roads tended to do that. She had to admit, she was having a nice evening in spite of herself. Maybe shed have more than a single drink downstairs. Maybe there would be a boy down there a trifle closer to thirty than twenty. One with the same broad shoulders as Paul. Two drinks will be fine, she decided. But as fate would have it, she wouldnt be having a single drink that night.
Just as she took the first step down from the third-floor landing, there was sudden screaming. Shrieking and screaming, in a register reserved for the most profound of horrors. Ear-splitting feminine screams were blood-curdling. At first it was just one or two females, but soon there were cries from a dozen or more people, boys and girls alike. 
She dashed down the stairs ripping away the sleep mask from her face
There was a loud thud against a wall on the bottom floor, shaking the house. She moved faster, breath caught, eyes wide and frantic. The hatch was closed. The screaming continued, punctuated with the unforgettable pleas of the terror-stricken.
She slipped a pair of fingers through the iron ring of the hatch and pulled: it budged only slightly before seating firmly, as if someone was on the other side of it with a firm grip of the handle.
Norrah shouted at the hatch, Let me in! Open the door! She yanked furiously at the iron ring to no avail.
A chill ran the length of her spine when a feminine shriek cut off abruptly, not from will but from inability, as though the life was ripped out of her with a cataclysmic blow. Norrah abandoned the hatch and hauled ass to the kitchen, uncradled the phone and dialed nine-one-one with tremulous fingers. Just then Paul came out of the bathroom off the den and stared pie-eyed at Norrah. From his expression she knew that he was just as thunderstruck and stupefied as was she.
Whats happening down there! She shouted at him.
I He turned and went to the front door, unlocked it muttering, Fuck me. He went out the door and didnt close it behind him.
What the hell is happening, she said inwardly, in full panic-mode.
The emergency operator answered the call. The ensuing dialogue between Norrah and the operator would be played over and over again on the news for days to come. The thing about the recording is you cant hear the screams in the background. Not that they should have been heard, because the twenty-three were downstairs with a heavily insulated ceiling separating them from Norrah, and the speaker of the phone was practically being eaten by her. That and many of the screams had already subsided by then. But still, youd think that youd be able to hear one or two screams at least faintly, wouldnt you?
Nine-one-one, please state your emergency, the woman said apathetically.
I need help! I need help! Please hurry!
Maam, what is
Hurry! Somethings happening downstairs, I I dont know what! Just send help right now!
Calm down, maam, Im sending you help right now. What is the nature of your emergency?
Fuck if I know! People are getting killed I think! Norrah heard more screams come to a fatal stop and knew that she was right in saying people were getting killed. She dropped the phone on the counter and instead of checking the hatch, she went to the front door not to go around the house and help those below, but to close and lock it. She couldnt help those downstairs, that was pretty evident. If twenty-something people couldnt stop whatever or whoever was attacking them, how could she? She owned a handgun, an old Beretta that her father had bought her many years ago. He didnt like the idea of his daughter living alone, especially in a neighborhood as remote as hers. He had bought it and gave it to her with a full magazine of bullets. She had never fired the gun but considered she might be firing it tonight. But at what? At whom? 
She ran for the stairs and took them two at a time. She slid to her knees before her bed and fished around blindly, felt a shoe-box and slid it out. She flung the lid off and gripped the gun, got up and walked into the hall with the gun pointed down before her. She noticed the screaming had stopped. Had it just stopped or had she just now noticed? She couldnt say. There was Viva la Vida coming to an end on the stereo, and nothing more. When the song ended, a new song replaced it. In the two seconds bridging the songs was utter silence. She stopped at the top of the stairs, gun now aiming down. She had ideas, dark ones. A man or men would come up through the hatch looking for her. The gun in her hand was light-years away from being steady. She swallowed dryly. She wished the damn music would stop so she could listen.
It was the longest fifteen minutes of her life, spent between the top two steps of the stairs. She nearly cried with relief when she heard distant sirens. When they stopped just outside her house, she descended the stairs, gun still at the ready. The hatch remained closed. She furtively made her way across the living room into the kitchen, gun pointing in the direction of her every glance. The front door tried to open, but it was locked. There was a loud knock and a Police!
She lowered the gun and unlocked the door, opened it. The cop was a tall chubby man with a gun in hand. He stared down at the gun in Norrahs hand, then met eyes with her.
She stammered at him, tried to tell him what she all but knew, that a couple dozen people were just brutally murdered downstairs, but couldnt get herself to say it. Perhaps he gleaned it from her wide glazed eyes, unhinged jaw, and palsy. He brushed by her, led with his gun.
Call for m-more cops, she said desperately as she closed the door. She hurried after the man. He began ascending the stairs.
Not up there, Norrah said. Downstairs. Downstairs!
He turned around and stopped at the hatch, stooped over and pulled the iron ring, opened the carpeted portal door with a grating of its hinges.
Careful! Norrah shouted. Be careful!
Norrah went to the stairs and stopped, awaited news from the cop who was now invisible below. When she heard the front door open she aimed her gun in that direction. Another cop was now inside, and that cop was myself.
Jesus Christ, I said, lower your gun. Whats going on here?
She lowered the gun. I cant accurately enough describe how shitty Norrah looked. It was a palpable dread, the kind that follows witnessing death, particularly first-degree murder. Ive seen similar looks, but none more profound than Norrahs just then. 
I dont know, she said half-frenzied.
Is that you, Davis? Fred shouted from down below.
Yeah! I walked past Norrah and descended the steps into the basement. Norrah followed close at my heels.
Downstairs was kind of a studio apartment, as I had mentioned. On a dresser was a stereo that I turned off. Silence engulfed the sizeable room. There was a large bed, some night-stands, a long dresser, a small circular table with three chairs, a TV on a stand, and not much else. There were windows with drinks on the sills. Plastic cups that had alcohol in them, ice still shapely inside. The table had several cups on it, drinks ranging from full to empty, ice still shapely there as well. The place was vacant.
Fred was the first to ask the question, though I was a second away from asking the same thing. Maam, whats the emergency?
Norrah walked to the bathroom and opened the door: empty. What I I dont understand. She faced me and said, I was upstairs when I heard people screaming down here. There was a party, twenty or so people here, just fifteen minutes ago. I heard things bad things. I dont get it where did they go?
Fred and I stepped out the back door together after I flipped a switch, illuminating a single low-watt light just outside the door. Norrah came out with us. There was no snow due to the patio being under the upstairs deck, but where the deck ended there was a bank of snow two feet tall, packed down in places from where Phantom of the Opera and Mouse had conversed with Norrah recently. Fred took his Maglite out of his utility belt and shone it there. There were footsteps leading away from the house; Norrah had no idea who made them.
Hello? Fred said down the path the footsteps made.
This is crazy, Norrah said from behind me. I looked back at her. Twenty people dont just up and disappear.
I gave her a skeptical look. I considered that she might be on medication or perhaps needed to be on some.
How long since you last saw them? I asked her.
Like I said, fifteen minutes or so.
Fred followed the steps in the snow. I stayed behind and looked around, went to both ends of the patio, unsure of what I was looking for. It was evident nobody was here but the three of us. It was as quiet as hellsnow has that effect.
Norrah returned inside.
Please keep in mind what I said about Norrah being an honest woman. Ill admit I didnt believe what she said in the ensuing moment, but Ive come to believe she did witness what she claimed to have. I truly do.
Norrah shrieked.
I hurried inside, gun holstered. I thought the need to be readily armed had come to an end, and I was right. Norrah was covering her face.
Whats up? I asked.
When she uncovered her face to meet eyes with me, my breath caught. It caught because this woman looked like she just saw something pretty fucking terrifying. Here is how she described it to me four days later over a cup of coffee at Starbucks:
Jay, Ill only tell you if you swear to God you wont think Im making it up. You either promise to believe me or I wont tell you. Swear it.
I did swear it, and I meant it. Cops grow an intuition keener than most others. We can tell if someone is full of shit or being honest, most of the time. I suppose some people believe the bullshit stories theyre telling, making them appear credible, but this wasnt a case of that. She was sane and she wasnt blowing smoke up my ass.
And dont tell anyone else about what Im about to say. I dont want anyone thinking Im nuts.
If it could aid in the investigation, Im afraid I cant promise that. Ill do whats best for you and those missing twenty-three, that I promise you. Tell me, Norrah, tell me what you saw.
She took a deep breath and looked away. A tear rolled down her cheek. When I went back inside I saw I saw She shook her head and closed her eyes, displacing tears. I cant get myself to say it.
I reached across the table and took her right hand between mine and squeezed. I thought it might be inappropriate, but she looked like she could use the comfort, slight as it was. And I really did want her to get this off her chest.
Tell me, I wont judge you, I vowed. I believe you, Norrah. I know you arent bullshitting me. Do you believe me when I say that?
She nodded once. I saw them. I saw them, Jay, I saw them. I dont know if I saw all of them, it didnt last long, but there were many people. And and they were dead.
I grasped for understanding, squeezed her hand harder. You saw the missing people? And they were dead? What do you mean?
I saw them, like they had been invisible but for a moment they werent. Blood everywhere, bodies everywhere. The blinds on the far window, the cord to lower and raise them it was tied around someones neck. There was a man lying face-down on the bed, his back opened up; I could see his insides. I saw a headless body in a red dress. There was a guy in a tux on the floor with his arms gone, like they were ripped out.
How long did this last?
Just a couple seconds, then they blinked away. It looked like I imagined it might look when I heard them screaming from upstairs. It its like it confirmed what I knew, that those people didnt run away, they were murdered.
I nodded and stared down at our joined hands.
You dont believe me, do you, she said softly.
I do. I honestly do.
How? How could you believe that? I wouldnt even believe it if I didnt see it for myself.
Because twenty-three people dont vanish from thin air. Something really fucked up happened and there is no logical explanation for it. So the illogical is all that remains. Theres something else.
What?
Its something I shouldnt mention. I heard it from a buddy of mine, who heard it from a detective. Keep this to yourself, will you?
Yes, she said impatiently, now tell me.
On the bed. The comforter. Where was the body you saw? Was in centered on the bed?
No, it was on the side of it. The left side.
I nodded knowingly. There was only one piece of evidence found of foul play, that being a single drop of blood. A single drop of blood. What you described would hint at pints of blood, not a single drop, but a drop is something. It was on the comforter. On the edge of the bed, left side.
Did they test it?
Oh for sure. Well I dont know that to be a fact, but of course forensics would run a DNA test on it. I doubt they have the results from it so soon. It could be Pauls, well see. Its a coincidence that it was in the same place you saw a butchered body, though, isnt it?
I suppose. Inwardly she said, But a single drop? Its just so absurd. Nonsensical.
I know it is. Well get this sorted out. We need to be patient.
Do you really believe that?
I didnt answer because I didnt believe it.
Back to Valentines Day. I had asked her what she saw and she wouldnt answer me. Nothing looked out of the ordinary, so I didnt press her for an answer. A moment later Fred re-entered the house saying, Come check this out, to me.
I followed him outside, the narrow beam of his flashlight leading the way down the path of now two sets of tracks in the snow. Fifteen steps or so later we were between the trunks of two large Pine trees. We stopped side-by-side, six feet away from the final pair of footsteps. They ended, no trace of where the man or woman went from there. Judging from the size of the imprints, it was likely a male who made them. Just past the final set of tracks was a pair of impressions. I thought they may have been knee prints.
Odd, I said. He must have back-stepped in his own tracks.
Yes, but why would he do that?
No idea. I looked back at the now-several footprints in the snow. It hints at something bad, though, wouldnt you agree? If he was deliberately trying to throw us off, hes hiding a truth from us. Did you find tracks leading from the patio toward the sides of the house?
There are tracks on that side. He pointed to the side of the house the guests had used to reach the basement from the street. But it was mostly a single line of tracks, as if the guests of the party had come one and two at a time. If there was a mass exodus, there would be tracks wider than what there is. People dont haul ass in a single-rank file. They spread out.
Norrah was in the doorway. I said to her, Maam does anyone live here with you?
Yes. There is a young man who lives down here. He was upstairs when it happened, in the bathroom. He left before you guys got here. Im not sure why. Afraid, I guess. He heard the screaming too, had to have.
I called dispatch, requested additional units. I wanted to ask for homicide but didnt. Not yet I didnt. I asked Norrah where this tenant may have gone. She had no idea. 
It was an hour later when he arrived back at her house, that Paul kid. By then there were better than fifteen cops on location, and a couple of detectives had just arrived. Paul was questioned in private, so I dont know exactly what he was asked and how he replied. All I know is he was believed to be innocent of any wrong-doing. I surmise he was considered to be a chicken-shit and fled the scene before he ended up dead. He was told not leave the region in the coming days, and hed be questioned a few more times before it was all said and done. Being a lowly cop I didnt get to sit in on the interrogations, nor discoursed of their results. I concluded that Paul was lucky to have been upstairs when it happened, or hed be the twenty-fourth missing person. Its not like he killed twenty-three people in the span of a few minutes and hid their bodies so well that they couldnt be found. Thats impossible. And the guy isnt very big. I doubt he could transport a body very far. And besides, he was upstairs when it happened. What a cluster-fuck it was. So utterly perplexing.
By the following day there were news-vans lining both sides of the street (partiers vehicles had been towed and impounded, considered evidenceat least for now) and by that evening the feds were involved. Twenty-three people missing, vanished without a trace. Well, there was that one drop of blood.

Chapter Two

Paul had been staying at his friends house down the mountain, in Highland. Or so he said. You cant take much of what he says literally. Fucker lies when hes not busy speaking vaguely. He avoided Norrahs like it was the plague, and for good reason. How could he get any rest in such an environment? It wasnt until the third day that she was able to sleep herself. It was that third night that she had the house to herself, though there were plenty of news-vans outside, eager to break some kind of development. And theyd get that development, all right. Boy would they, but not for a few more days. She slept like shit that night, but she did get some sleep. 
The fourth day is when she called me. I had given her my number and said please call me if you need a set of ears to listen. I was a little surprised when she took me up on that offer. I guess the phantoms of the dead she witnessed weighed heavily upon her and she wanted to get it out in the open. Talking is therapeutic. We met at Starbucks and sat for an hour or so, talked about non-related issues for the better part of it. She said she wanted a return to normalcy, didnt think that would ever happen. At the end of our meeting I offered to buy her a steak dinner at The Boathouse in the business district of Lake Arrowhead. It was a proposal of a date, I didnt try to disguise that. I sensed shed accept because it would mean she wouldnt be alone, and I was doing my best to instill a sense of trust of me in her. Someone to confide in. She accepted my offer. Is it just me or when a gal accepts your proposal of a first date do you immediately wonder if youll see what she looks like under those clothes? The first date is the first stepping stone that leads to unveiling those glorious boobs. I think Confucius wrote that.
That evening was one Ill never forget, and it had nothing to do with the mystery of Valentines Day. We agreed as we walked toward the restaurant that we wouldnt mention what had happened, that wed keep our conversation anywhere but on the missing twenty-three. And we did. It was during our dinner that I realized I found someone special in Norrah Petersen. I am twenty-eight, two years her junior, and had been single for over a year, ready to find a woman to get serious with. The circumstance was pure shit that brought us together, but stuff happens for a reason. And she says I was just what she needed in her life just then, but Im not sure if she meant I offered her a distraction from the fiasco or I filled a void in her life that is love. Love is what it was, though it took some time to develop. We had such a wonderful evening that we agreed to do it again tomorrowthough at a less expensive restaurant. Wed spend time together every day from then on. When our schedules didnt allow for us to meet in person, wed call the other and have hours-long conversations.
It was on the sixth day following Valentines Day that I asked her if shed consider dating a cop, which was a roundabout way of asking if shed date me. Some people have hang-ups with dating cops, understandably so, so it was a fair question. I asked her this over the phone, was nervous to do it in person. She said yes, and I sensed her grin. She then invited me over to her house for a home-made dinner on the following evening. I agreed to the proposal and said Id bring a pie and bottle of Chardonnay. She set the date for seven in the evening, if it worked for me. I would be working till seven, so Id need a half hour to shower and change and trim my nose-hairs, but I only lived ten minutes from her house, so 7:40 would be perfect if it suited her. It did and the date was set. 
As you know, seven days following Valentines Day was when the second half of the biggest news story of Arrowhead history took place. You might not know that I was there when it happened.
It was a quarter to eight when I arrived. I gawped at Norrah when she opened the door for me, how beautifully she was made up. A dark green satin dress, hair up, a silver necklace and diamond earrings, make-up was something she didnt just throw on, she had made herself up something splendid. A Vogue magazine cover she was. Again I wondered if Id be taking a gander at the goods under the threads. You cant blame me for being a guy.
She looked past me at the parked news vans, commented that she thought theyd never leave. I agreed. News was at the highest ratings theyd gotten in years, maybe ever. Local news teams were getting national syndication from their footage and interviews. The interviews were with neighbors and some cops here and there, never Norrah. She refused interviews (at first), and Im glad she did. Fuck those salivating journalists (pardon my language). I know they have a job to do, but their interests dont lie in my Norrahs well-being but in their careers.
Oh my, you look stunning, I said and crossed the threshold.
Thank you, she said with a sweet grin. Her cheeks ball up when she grins more than the average smiler. It does wonders to her allure. A good smile can make an average-looking girl appear good-looking, and in Norrahs case it makes a good-looking girl become gorgeous. And those straight white teeth and sensuous lips, they really set off her smile. I apologize for getting off track. Its hard not to talk about what a gal I have in Norrah. Im truly blessed. And in case youre wondering, I have seen what lies under those threads and its spectacular.
You look handsome yourself, she said. I wore a dark suit and red tie. I thanked her.
On the dining table was a casserole dish covered in foil. There were two squat lit candles on the table. The kitchen light was on a dimmer and set low. In the living room a small lamp was on. The overall lighting was meager, the perfect kind for such an evening. She had made lasagna from scratch and I ate two big ass pieces of it. She eats like a bird, and claimed to be stuffed after only eating half of a modestly sized piece. She apologized for not opening my Chardonnay, but Italian food goes with red wine, so she poured us some Cabernet. She was right, it went perfectly with the lasagna. We killed the bottle between the two of us. 
I put my fork down and said dinner was amazing. I was so stuffed that it hurt to breathe deeply. The wine was giving me all kinds of confidence so I elected to get a little personal with her. Im really glad we met, Norrah. I mean it. Yeah it sucks why we met, but still. Im so lucky to have met you. I havent been this happy in a while.
Youre sweet to say. I feel the same way. Dont take this the wrong way, because Im not using you for a distraction, but you can see how you are just that. But honestly, Jay, even if that thing didnt happen, Id still wish to be eating dinner with you right now. You are a thoughtful, generous, kind man. I am the fortunate one, not you.
I smiled at her. I guess my eyes were glassy, partly because of the wine, but mostly because her words hit me just the right way. I got up from my chair and extended a hand at her, palm up, ever the cavalier. She took it and got up. I escorted her to the living room, put a hand on her waist, the other over her hand, and began slow-dancing with her. By the way she moved, I knew this was something she loved dearly. She said dancing to music would be even better, so she turned on the entertainment center and pushed a few buttons. Seconds later we were listening to classical music. I dont know who the composer was, but it was a series of Waltzes. Good music to dance to. Slow but not too slow.
It was nearing nine PM. At the end of a Waltz we stopped dancing and embraced. I raked my fingers across her tied-back hair, cupped her cheek, gazed in her eyes, gave her the first of many kisses. It was a timeless kiss, one lasting both seconds and an eternity. I was so very ashamed of what my body decided to do during that kiss, and she felt it pressing against her lower abdomen. She said nothing of it, thankfully. I couldnt help it! You try hugging and kissing a girl as wonderful and beautiful as Norrah and not get a boner. After the kiss she rested her head on my shoulder and we swayed slowly, rhythmically. I rubbed her lower back, smelled her hair which was so pleasingly fragrant. Damn those missing twenty-three. How selfish, I know, but it always remained in my conscious mind, that this was happening because of them. 
I hope this never ends, I said to her.
It wont. Unless you pull the plug on it.
Never.
The subsequent Waltz was a short one. Following it was the first of a series of orchestral compositions. Not the kind of stuff made to dance to. We stepped to the couch and took a seat, our knees touching, and got to kissing once again. It got to the point that I thought we might end up in her bedroom. I wanted to, thats for damned sure. My hand was getting a little exploratory, went under the skirt of her dress and crept mid-thigh. She allowed it. My heart was pounding.
The music entered a kind of quiet phase, where it was just a few violinists playing softly. The music was somewhat soft to begin with, so the room was fairly quiet when the music downstairs came on. All at once there was a Green Day song, Welcome to Paradise, playing on the basement stereo. It was loud enough that Norrah and I both flinched; she gasped. We met eyes, wide eyes. That was nothing in comparison to the look she gave me when we heard laughter downstairs. Fucking laughter! We sprang off the couch together and dashed to the closed hatch of the downstairs portal. She was first to arrive, gripped the metal ring and flung the hatch open in full. The loud music got louder, the laughter more pronounced. She flew down the stairs with me just inches behind her. It was a good thing I was close to her, because when she reached the bottom step she lost consciousness; I caught her as she fell. The sight of twenty-three revelers was more than she could handle.

Chapter Three

It had been seven days to the hour. My guess would be to the minute. It was as though a week of time had been cut out of existence for these guests. In the seven days since they had disappeared, nothing was cleaned or organized, or anything but inspected. Norrah and I saw the very drinks that had been collecting dust for seven days now being consumed. Were they wondering why their ice-cubesshapely only seconds agohad melted and their drinks were now room-temperature? Perhaps. But these fucking people were acting as though nothing had happened. I actually wondered if I what I was seeing were ghosts. But ghosts shouldnt look so non-transparent. 
A guy in a Phantom of the Opera mask rushed to us, asked if Norrah was all right. I didnt reply to him. Hell, I wasnt far off from joining Norrah there on the floor. Another couple approached us, asked what happened to her. I shook my head and eased Norrah to her back. I told the nearest guya guy wearing a Peacock maskto turn the music off. He turned it off seconds later. 
I groped the cell phone out of my slacks pocket and went into my contacts list, found Fred, the fat cop who was with me a week ago, pressed Call.
Yo, he said, whats up, Davis?
Fred, I said shortly.
Whats the good word?
Get your ass over to Norrahs this second.
Why? What happened?
You wont believe me.
A moment later he said, Are you there now?
Yes.
I hear people. Whos there?
You wont believe me.
No dont tell me thats impossible.
Just come over. Now.
Be there in five minutes.
Are you on duty?
You know I am.
I should have known it, but memory was coming by with great difficulty just then. Good. Make the call to dispatch. I want everyone here as soon as possible.
Davis, are you shitting me? Are you putting me on? I got to know before I make the call. This is nothing to joke about, you know that.
Just do it. And when you get here, tell the fucking news people to back up, give us space. Its about to become a three-ringed circus here. National news? No, international. Fred, theyre back. Theyre all back.
After I ended the call I took a seat on the bottom step of the stairs. Norrah was still out. There were several kids standing around her, worried for her. Absently I said shed be fine. With a little effort I sharpened my policing mind, asked where the hell theyve been over the last week. All I got in return were blank stares.
Where have you all been? Where!
A guy in a mouse mask asked what I meant. Just then the bathroom door opened and a couple came out. The guy zipped up his trousers. They were both flushed, undoubtedly just finished having sex.
For the last seven days, where the hell were you all!
Are you feeling okay? An unmasked girl asked concernedly.
Norrah began stirring. I got off the bottom stair and knelt beside her.
Honey, are you okay? I said to her. Her eyes opened weakly. Norrah, I need you to be strong for me right now. Can you do that for me?
She turned her head toward the gathering of six or seven well-dressed teens and twenty-somethings. Her eyes widened. She was awake, all right. 
Its okay, Norrah, its okay. I dont know what I meant by it. It was a damned retarded thing to say. Consolation has never been my thing. I took her by the hands and helped her to her feet.
What is this? She said to me in such a high tone that it sounded pre-adolescent.
I dont know. Cops are on their way.
Woah, woah, said the guy in a Phantom of the Opera mask. The cops are coming?
Yes. Im a cop, too. None of you are to leave here. Not a one of you.
Whats this about? Did we do something wrong? Norrah said we could be here, we didnt do anything wrong, he said defensively.
You didnt do anything wrong, I agreed.
This cant be happening, Norrah whispered incredulously. It cant be.
I couldnt agree more. It most certainly couldnt be happening. I heard one kid ask another where Paul was. Paul would be able to get Norrah to call off the cops, he judged. None of them seemed to know where Paul was, until a girl said she thought she saw him go upstairs a few minutes ago. Another girl overhead that and agreed, said he went up there to piss because Batman and Catwoman were busy getting it on in the bathroom.
A maskless boy whisked by me, mounted the stairs. I asked where he was going.
To get Paul.
Paul isnt here.
Hes not? Whered he go? He was still going up the stairs.
He moved out of here a week ago, hasnt been back since. Kid, why dont you come back down here. Nobody is to leave till I say you can. Got it? I mean it, Im detaining each and every one of you for the time being. I sensed horror in each of these kids who received my threatening words. Dont worry, nobody is in trouble.
A guy approached me from the far end of the room. He was the oldest one here, maybe late twenties. He wore a tux just like the rest of them, and wore a mask, only it was raked back high on his head. His name I now know to be Aaron Mendelssohn. Aaron will be writing his account of things on pages to come. When he arrived at my side he put his hand on my shoulder. I looked up at him with a questioning stare.
He leaned close to me and said, What day is it? The date. Whats the date? 
I stared silently at him in disbelief. I suppose my reaction meant something to him, because he grinned at me. He knew.

Chapter Four

It wasnt a half hour later when the end of Norrahs street was lit up like a ski resort at night. Reds and blues and cruiser high beams made daylight of the area, not to mention the light created by light-alls on stanchions provided by news teams. There were several news personalities standing before camera crews, and I would bet there were a dozen more news vans speeding up Highway 18 that very moment. I heard a helicopter arrive within that first hour. A second chopper twenty-minutes later. I kept waiting for the idiots to collide and crash, a fiery inferno claiming the lives of at least four, much more if they fell straight down onto the house or the street. Every single soul employed in my precinct was present. The San Bernardino Sheriff was in transit. The boys-in-blue had done a good job pushing back the insanity of the reporters, and eventually made a barricade. There was a steady stream of emergency vehicles and cruisers funneling in. By ten all reporters were having to zoom in to get a shot of her house worth half a shit. 
The kids were scared senseless. Their many questions went unanswered. All they had heard was that something was royally fucked up and yes it was a big deal. Nobody dared try to leave. More and more officers poured into the house. I took charge of Norrahs well-being and escorted her up to the third floor, brought her to the bed and laid her down. She was all kinds of wrong in the head. I suppose Id have been in the same dire state if my policing mind hadnt taken over as my governing force. I was acting on some instinctive level. Part of me was the man who was newly dating Norrah, but a larger part of me was a cop who was caring for a woman so utterly distraught. 
Dan Oliver is a sergeant and friend of mine. I asked him for a huge favor, to stand outside the bedroom and be considerate of who entered. Soon would come the time when wed both have to give statements to detectives, but that time hadnt yet arrived. I told Oliver the gist of it all, that it was seven days probably to the minute when the missing kids reappeared, and they have no knowledge of having left. Oliver looked at me like I was some kind of idiot.
In the back of my mind was a little nugget of knowledge that I clung to, that of the man who asked me the date. I debated myself whether I should tell anyone this. It was a huge thing, I grasped that. But did I want it to be known to everyone just then? As I mentioned, cops act on instinct more times than not, and my visceral reaction was to keep it to myself for now, until I could dissect the matter at length, and get Norrah involved. I could tell my boss about him later. I could say it slipped my mind, that I was too upset by the phenomenon that is vanished people being un-vanished to have given the guys speculative words any consideration. Aaron had asked me what day it was, and I couldnt conclude any differently, that he knew damn well that they had lapsed in time somehow. Id have to get Aaron alone soon enough to ask him some questions, with Norrah at my side.
We were alone in her bedroom for twenty minutes when Norrah requested that I go downstairs to get her purse. I sent Oliver to get it, a white purse on the kitchen counter. A minute later I had the purse in hand. I could see dozens of my brethren down in the living room. Williams waved me down: I shook my head at him with an apologetic grin. I went inside the room and closed the door, went to the bed and turned on a second lamp. Norrah dug in her purse for her cell phone. I had a good idea who she was calling.
Paul, its me, Norrah. You need to call me right away. Your friends have all been found. Call me. Now.
She ended the call and looked over at me. What do you think happened? She asked.
I shrugged.
I know you dont know, but tell me what you think happened. Give me the possibilities, because I cant think of any.
Neither can I. But I think one of the guys downstairs might have an opinion. Maybe.
Who?
Just then her phone rang. She answered it, it was Paul. She put it on speaker-phone so I could hear.
Where were they found? Paul asked. He didnt sound as shocked as I figured he would be.
Downstairs.
What do you mean, downstairs?
I mean downstairs. They are downstairs. How many ways are there to interpret that?
You mean to tell me that theyre alive? Now he sounded shocked. It was as though he half expected them to be found, only it would be their lifeless bodies discovered, not living people.
Yes theyre alive.
Impossible.
Tell me about it. Why are you so surprised that theyre alive? In her voice was accusation.
I dont know. I just figured. I heard what you heard, their screams.
Yeah, I suppose so, she conceded. Youd better come home.
Why?
I dont know, it just seems appropriate, dont you think?
Id rather not be stuck in the middle of this mess.
Its too late for that, she said crossly. And why should I suffer through this shit alone? Youre more responsible for this than I am. Own up to it. At least nobody will question you as if youre a possible murderer anymore. Theyre safe, so just come home.
Nah, Im going to stay here. See ya. He hung up.
You little shit! She flung the phone on the bed.
I touched her knee, waited for her to look me in the eyes before saying a guy downstairs might know they had disappeared. I explained what had happened. She thought I should tell my boss, that it was no minor thing. I had mixed feelings about it. I said I would tell my supervisor, but only after we spoke with the guy first. I felt we deserved that much. Nobody deserved answers more than Norrah, after all she went through. She thought Id better get his phone number, because once he left the house it was unlikely Id get a second chance at questioning him. I asked if shed be all right alone for a few minutes. She said hurry back and meant it.
I went down the first flight of stairs. Several of my co-workers approached me and asked what the hell happened. That was a question asked with the same high tone by everyone, and worded exactly the same. What the hell happened? I just shook my head at them. On the dining table were our plates, a casserole mostly intact. To think we ate there contentedly so recently ago that the lasagna would still be warm it seemed like days ago that we were giggling at each other over dinner like a couple of horny teenagers. Jerry Bagwella rookie on the forcementioned that Lieutenant Daniels was looking for me. I said Id find him in a minute, and sped off down to the basement.
The kids down there looked miserable. Some looked annoyed. One girl was crying. A few sat on the bed, a few in the chairs, a couple sat on the carpeted floor with their backs to the wall, heads hung low. A couple kids sat on the stone hearth, and they were whispering to one another with brooding eyes. You wouldnt imagine kids dressed so smartly could be so collectively put out, and the lot of them were nonplussed. Every boy was adorned in a tux, girls wore dresses befitting of a prom. None wore masks. Poor kids must have been really confused. I felt for them, I really did. And they didnt know the half of it, yet. They were surely being asked where theyd been over the last week, and that would make no sense to them. Well, it might make sense to one of them, the one I was seeking. The rest would be thinking back two weeks, not one. A couple cops were interviewing randomly chosen masqueraders. I went straight to the oldest looking one of the lot, Aaron, who was by himself, leaning a shoulder against the wall. I went to the back door and gestured at him with a nod to follow me. He did. Together he and I went out the back door; I closed it behind us.
I extended my hand and said, Im Jay.
Aaron, he said and shook my hand. Aaron Mendelssohn.
Judging books by their covers is second-nature to cops. Were the judge and jury. This guy was straight in the head, and a good guy. Either a good guy or great guy: it was too soon to peg him to that degree. We stared at one another for a moment. It was mostly dark, the single weak light trying its best to overcome the oppressive darkness of the winter night. It was well below freezing, our breaths balloons of vapor. It wasnt long before his teeth began chattering. Most people who live in the mountains grow hardened to low temperatures. People who live in the flatlands cant last five minutes in sub-freezing weather without chattering their teeth and rubbing their arms and asking if its normal for it to be this cold out.
Its the twenty-first of February, I said. Seven days after the party. I gauged his reaction. It didnt seem to surprise him in the least. He simply nodded. I had confirmed to him what he already knew, or at least suspected.
Where were you during those seven days? Without food and water and shelter? What the fuck, man?
I dont know, he said, and it was a candid answer.
But you do know you were gone.
Not necessarily.
Dude, what happened? This stays between us, unless you dont want it to. I got to know what happened, or what might have happened. You seem to be the only one who has any idea that you all disappeared. How do you know that, and why just you? Or maybe its not just you. Might others know?
He sighed, looked away from me. I shouldnt have asked you that. Theyre going to think I had something to do with this, arent they?
Like I said, this stays between you and me. For now, at least. Come on, man, tell me what you know.
He rubbed his blue-white hands together, breathed on them, looked up at me. How many kids did you count in there?
I didnt count.
Well I did. There are twenty-three including myself. If it had been nine months instead of a week that we went missing, maybe thered be twenty-four: a couple were actually screwing in the bathroom, shamelessly. Proudly. Can you believe that?
So there are twenty-three. What are you driving at?
I made it a point to count them earlier this evening. I thought it was strange he would do so, but said nothing. He amended, I mean earlier in the evening a week ago. There were twenty-five. I counted them, Jay.
Twenty five? Are you sure?
He nodded. Paul was the twenty-fourth.
Who was the twenty-fifth?
He faced me more squarely, stepped closer to me, hugged tighter his shivering body, and in a hushed voice said, Thats the question for the ages. The twenty-fifth is who pulled the strings here. Hes the one.
How do you know that? You dont know who he is?
Aaron didnt answer. He looked over his shoulder at the closed door. Theres no need to mention him, no reason to begin an investigation; we wont see him again.
Buddy, what youre telling me isnt helping for shit. What arent you telling me?
He shook his head once, blew into his hands. 
Could you at least give me a description of him?
Sure. That I can do. He was the only one masquerading as a man. That truly is a disguise, a facade.
I stared stupidly at him. The back door opened. It was the Lieutenant. I said give me just a moment. When the door closed I asked Aaron for his phone number, and entered it into my phone, said Id be calling him in the very near future.

Chapter Five

It was the next day when Norrah and I went for a drive, away from her house. Anywhere beat being there at her house. The media was still beside themselves. Norrah was looking for an escape and I was happy to give her one. We took my Chevy Tahoe because it was four-wheel drive and it had been snowing off and on all afternoon. It was almost evening, the roads a little icy, and the road leading from her house was lined with news vans. I had a surprise lined up for her. She knew we were going to Don Pepes Mexican restaurant in the nearby town of Twin Peaks, but didnt know I had arranged earlier that morning to meet Aaron there at six. 
There was one precondition laid out by Aaron before agreeing to the meeting, and that was he didnt want to talk about the twenty-fifth masquerader. I agreed to the stipulation because I wanted his company, and if thats the only way hed agree to meet us, then so be it. But I didnt plan on adhering to the negotiated terms.
Twin Peaks is a small town, just far enough away from Arrowhead to ensure we wouldnt be hounded by the media. The restaurant is small, only one waitress, and there were only three other parties there when we were seated, five minutes before the hour. The waitress took our drink orders after dropping off a tray of hot chips and salsa: I imperiously ordered three margaritas. The lady walked off. Before Norrah asked why I ordered three, I said we were having a special guest. I then recalled the guy who had an idea that some amount of time had lapsed between the beginning of the party and the conclusion.
Really? Hes coming? She sounded delighted by the news.
I nodded. He made me promise I wouldnt ask him about the twenty-fifth masquerader.
What do you mean twenty-fifth?
There were twenty-three people down there. Twenty-three people confirmed to have gone missing. Paul was the twenty-fourth, but then he never went missing. There was another man, according to Aaronthe guy who is meeting us here shortly. He thinks the twenty-fifth masquerader has something to do with what happened.
The hell Im not going to bring it up!
I know, I know, I said with a smile. I want answers, too, you better believe it. But it was a condition of this meeting, not to bring it up.
Then whats the point of meeting him? What are we going to talk about, the weather? She said sarcastically.
Is it normal for it to be this cold out? I intoned and humored. I glanced out the window by our table, saw a silver Toyota Tacoma enshrouded in road-dust pull into a parking spot. It was Aaron. Maybe hell talk about it on his own. Im a little curious how he fits into the picture. Hes older than the rest; I doubt he goes to college with the others, but maybe Im wrong.
The margaritas were dropped off just before Aaron entered the eatery. I held up a hand and beckoned him like a mafia Don. He came our way.
I introduced the two. I relocated across the bench seat beside Norrah. He sat facing us and looked undecidedly at the mug of green slush on his side of the table.
Have a drink, bud, I said.
Sorry, but Im not a drinker.
No? I said. You werent drinking at the party? Why go to a party if youre a teetotaler?
Must we delve into this topic so soon? Im starving, was hoping to enjoy some of what I eat.
Fair enough, I said. Im sorry.
Dont be.
I dont believe Ive seen you before, Norrah said to Aaron. It is commonplace to recognize most people on the mountain. They are small towns up here, a tightly-knit community. If you dont recognize someone, theres a good chance that either they are new to the area or a flatlander (a disparaging term used for anyone who doesnt live on the mountain) visiting a relative or up for a day of skiing. 
I dont live around here.
Where do you live? She pursued.
Fresno.
Fresno? Norrah and I said together.
Yes. This area is new to me.
Why are you here? I asked him. Do you have family or friends here? One of the kids at the party?
No. He gestured at the waitress. Once he had her attention he asked for a glass of water. 
Norrah and I waited for him to elaborate, or at least feed our curiosity in the slightest, but he had nothing else to add.
There was an awkward silence that ended when the waitress dropped off three glasses of water and asked if we were ready to order. Norrah and I were both knowledgeable of the menu, having had eaten there many times, so we ordered. Aaron hadnt looked at the menu, but said hed have the same thing I was having, a carne asada burrito. Once the chick jotted the shit down and left, Aaron took the opportunity to begin a new topic before Norrah and I could dictate the conversation.
So what do you do for a living? He asked her, but looked at me as well.
Im a cop, as you know, I said. I assume you know.
Yeah, I heard you say that. And you?
I work at a grocery store, Norrah said shamefully, but go to college, she said hopefully.
Good for you. Aaron sipped his water. How long have you been a cop?
Six years.
Love it or hate it?
Something in-between.
How about you, Norrah? Love it or hate it?
Hate it. Thats why Im going to school.
To become what?
Im majoring in accounting. Maybe Ill work at H&R Block or something, I dont know. Im good with numbers, and accountants make decent money.
Sure, Aaron said.
How about you? Norrah asked. What do you do?
Now we were getting somewhere. Maybe it wouldnt lead to anything tangible to our inquest, but it was a step in the right direction.
Im a teacher.
I could see that, him being a teacher. He had that smart-guy kind of look. Clean shaven, dark hair tightly cropped and parted on the side. He was slender and at least four inches shorter than me, putting him at about five-nine. He wore a red checked flannel shirt under a black woolen jacket. 
Oh? What do you teach? Norrah inquired.
Middle-school, history and English. Im a substitute teacher. I took a little time off work, am staying in the area for a couple weeksthough I got short-changed out of a week of my vacation, he said with a wink.
You teach in Fresno?
Yes, maam.
We both wanted to ask it, but it was me who got to it first. What brings you here to Lake Arrowhead?
Instead of answering he sipped his water, then bit into a chip.
Not wanting to answer that, huh? I said.
He looked at me undecidedly. Eh my answer would stem new questions Im not eager to answer.
Who invited you to the party? I asked.
Nobody.
Nobody? You crashed the party?
He nodded.
Forgive me, Norrah said, but I find it intriguing that a teacher would crash a party hundreds of miles from where he lives. Cant you tell us more?
Before he could shoot us down with a frustrating non-answer, I asked another question: Paul was okay with you joining the party? A stranger?
Thats the beauty of a masquerade party. Its customary not to ask who the others are. I suppose most people can figure out who the masked people are, but not always, and not everybody. Nobody asked who I was. People just assume youre friends of someone and thats just fine. Alcohol is the social lubricant of the machine that is a party, and folks are having too much fun to police the party by finding out who shouldnt be there, who wasnt invited and who was. I was just another guy who was wanting to have a good time. People can appreciate that.
But you dont drink, Norrah said with a puzzled expression.
I dont.
Then why were you there? Cant you understand how confusing this is to us?
I can.
What if I told you that I swear on my mortal soul, I said, that what you tell us will stay between us now and forever. You can tell us anything and it wont leave this room.
I swear, too, Norrah said. I think Ill die if you dont tell me what you know.
Aaron grinned at us both, ate another chip. While chewing he said, You must think Im enjoying this, keeping what I know mum. It isnt so. I just fear being the subject of interviews and accusations. I live a quiet life and want to continue that. Just having been present at the party has put me on the radar and I dont wish to travel farther along that path of fame or infamy, if you know what I mean. But I do believe you. You seem like good people. Are you two a couple?
I said no as Norrah said yes. I gaped over at her. She was embarrassed. Im so sorry, she squeaked. I shouldnt have assumed that.
Dont be sorry! I just thought Id freak you out if I said yes. I really like you, Norrah, and Im honored that you consider me your well, that were a couple.
She looked satisfied with that. I kissed her briskly on the lips. 
Aaron smiled at us. Im a pastor, he said.
Beg pardon? I said.
A pastor. Im a pastor.
I thought you were a teacher? Norrah said.
Isnt that what a pastor is?
Touch, I said.
He chuckled. Im both. I teach on the weekdays, give sermons on Sundays at Calvary Chapel.
Norrah was agape. She then blinked the incredulous expression away and apologized. Its just that you look so young to be a pastor. And a teacher, for that matter.
Im twenty-eight, not that young. I know I look younger, I hear it a lot.
A pastor-teacher, crashing a teen party hundreds of miles away. Nothing unusual about that, I said jocularly.
Nothing at all, huh, Aaron said and laughed harder this time. As a man of faith, my word is stone. When I promise something, you can take it to the bank. Im hoping you two share that creed. You made me a promise and I dont take that lightly.
As well you shouldnt, I said. I know a cop isnt as moral or venerable a profession as a teacher and pastor, but my word, my honor, means just as much to me as it does to you.
Have either of you read the bible? He asked, looking first in her eyes, then mine.
Neither of us had. We reluctantly admitted it.
You should try it, he said. Its a good book. Not just the message of love and salvation and everlasting life, but in a literal sense, its a good book. Like any book, it has a kind of story, a plot, and its fascinating, enthralling. I say this not as a pastor but as someone who adores reading books.
We both nodded, curious as to where the heck he was going with this.
I have a friend sermonizing in my stead, at Calvary, for two weeks. But I have to get back up to Fresno by Sunday evening to teach classes on Monday. So I dont have much time left down here. If you two would like, we could get together a few more times before I head back. Id be honored.
Sure, Norrah said. All right, I said.
I dont know anyone here, so its nice to have met you two. Back to what I was getting at, the bible. Its a big thing Im about to ask of you two, but would you read the bible for me?
Aaron was looking at the knitted brows of his company. Whats the point of this request, our expressions said.
Think of it as payment for me sharing with you what I know, he said. Deal?
I guess I could, I said. Any part in particular?
The whole thing is worth reading, but I guess the New Testament is a good place to start. The ending is what I really want you two to absorb. Pay extra attention.
Why is that? Asked Norrah.
Like I said, its payment. Im a pastor, you can hardly blame me for trying to teach the Word of God to two non-believers. He looked down and shook his head. Forgive me, I shouldnt have presumed you to be non-believers. But Id feel better with our relationship if you gave the bible a read.
If we do that, youll tell us everything we want to know?
Yes.
Do we have to read it entirely before you tell us? Norrah asked.
He considered it. I dont know. Ill give it some thought.
How about instead of reading the bible, I said, I give you a more tangible payment; say, some cold hard cash? I winked, then chuckled.
Youd be doing yourselves a favor by reading it. Have an open mind, please. Maybe when youve finished it Ill drive back down, and if youd like I could baptize you both. If youre willing, of course.
Youre trying to convert us, I said, and that doesnt offend me, but you should know that Im already a Christian.
Me too, Norrah said.
Stating youre a Christian and being a Christian are two different things. Only God knows whats inside your heart of hearts. But if I had to guess, you two He cut himself short of finishing his thought.
What? I said.
Lets just say that when I die and if God is generous enough to have me in Heaven, I wouldnt be surprised to not find you two there. Quickly and sternly he added, Dont take that as a strike against your characters, or that I think you are unworthy of His grace. Im just saying that I wouldnt be surprised. Most people wont get into Heaven, thats all.
Whats this all about, really, I said kind of cryptically. Whats all this religion stuff have to do with anything?
Jay Norrah chided. Be respectful. Thats what pastors do, you know. They talk about God. Is it that unlikely that hed want to do the same with us? Think of it as a compliment, that he likes us so much that he wants to hang out with us more, namely in Heaven. She smiled bashfully at me. It was such a pretty smile, from such a pretty woman. I reciprocated the smile, and couldnt resist kissing her right then.
Youre a tender soul, Aaron said to her. You would be proof, if nothing else, that God exists. He created a gem in you.
Aww. Norrah blushed. Thats so sweet of you to say.
Watch it, bub, I said. That chick has become the property of Jay Davis, going on five minutes now. Go hitch your wagon to another dame, Father Aaron.
He laughed. Im not a father. Im not Catholic.
Oh. Sorry.
So when can I expect you two love-birds to begin reading the New Testament.
Man I said. You really are intent on us reading it, arent you?
He shrugged with a poorly concealed grin.
Ill start this evening, Norrah said. Hows that strike you.
Awesome.
I guess I could too, I said. But I dont have a bible.
You mean you didnt have a bible. I have two extras in my Tacoma, one for each of you.
Two? Is that a coincidence or planned? I asked.
He smiled broadly. The latter. But to be fair, I have more than two. I always carry several, in case I encounter someone interested in learning the Word of God.
I asked him where he was staying these two weeks of his vacation. The Lake Arrowhead Inn. It was about eight minutes from Norrahs, a little farther from my own house. He apologized for his bluntness before asking if wed mind getting together at either my place or Norrahs, as he couldnt afford to be eating at restaurants too frequently. He was having a hard enough time paying ninety bucks a night for two weeks at that inn. As poorly as teachers get paid, he said substitutes have it even worse. And his congregation at Calvary wasnt too vast, his salary almost nothing at all. The good Lord provided, though, and he was happy with what he was given. He would bring over some side-dishes purchased from Staters, said he wouldnt think of freeloading off of us.
We can get together at my place, I offered. And you dont need to bring food over, Aaron. You are a good man, do a lot for your community. Allow me to repay some of that kindness by feeding you. I can cook some mean rib-eyes.
He hummed enthusiastically at the idea of a rib-eye. That sounds delicious. Did I mention Im starving? He humored.
Hows tomorrow sound? Norrah asked Aaron.
Sounds great. Would you guys mind if we dined at Norrahs instead?
I dont see why not, she replied.
Not that its of much importance to me, but I wouldnt mind returning there. For personal reasons. Dont read too far into it, its nothing like that.
I had sipped to the bottom of my margarita. Norrah wasnt far behind me. When the senorita delivered our three hot plates of savory goodness, I ordered another rita for the lady, and got to drinking Aarons untouched green drink. The pastor wasnt kidding about being hungry: that dude tore into his burrito like it was his salvation. The remainder of our dinner-date was enjoyed with lighthearted topics, nothing about what happened on Valentines day. I guess a lot of that could be chalked up to knowing wed see him again tomorrow and a few more times before he embarked up north. We could afford to get a little chummy, and I thought it would make it all the easier for him to tell us what brought him hundreds of miles south, to a party that would live forever in history books, perhaps the very ones hed teach his students. I could be a patient guy, I knew hed tell me what he knew soon enough, assuming there were things to tell. For all I knew he might have only had a hunch that something would go down that fateful night, with nothing more to reveal to us than that.
Before we parted ways that evening, after a hand-shake and a genuine It was a pleasure to meet you, he reminded us that we both promised to start reading the bible, and handed us over a brand new copy of said book. Inside them, handwritten on the first leaf, was: To Jay (Norrah on her copy), may the Word of God live within you for eternity. Your friend, Aaron Mendelssohn.

Chapter Six

On the drive back to Norrahs we decided we really would begin reading the bible tonight, to honor our end of the bargain. To make it more lively, wed do it together. Neither of us were eager to separate from the other, so it worked out well. And we already had a couple margaritas in our system, so it was the foundation of a fun evening. We both had work in the morning, but that seemed like years away. The night was young, and we were enjoying our new relationship status. Dating, thats what we were. Maybe not boyfriend and girlfriend, but something just short of that. If she was confronted by a good looking man and asked out on a date, I believe shed have turned him down with the reason being that she was seeing someone, sorry. Id have said the same thing. We were in the throes of a monogamous relationship; is there anything more blissful than that? A new commitment with a new partner? Would we be with the other for the rest of our lives? Marriage? Kids? Joint 401k plans and family health plans? The skys the limit, the possibilities endless and marvelous to daydream over. My spirits couldnt get any higher, despite the missing twenty-three turned found twenty-three. 
We went to her house. There was no police presence here, excluding myself. A news personalitya rather famous onemet us at her driveway to request an interview with Norrah. She said not this time and walked past him. He was whining about people needing to understand things and blah-blah-blah as we went inside; the same old song and dance, a stale tune. Shed begin interviewing soon enough. 
She locked the door behind us. Our minds would be preoccupied at her home, so I offered to take her to my cabin instead. I had some wine there, and would love to turn them into empty bottles with her. She liked the idea. She changed into something more casual upstairs as I waited in the living room. On a whim I decided to venture downstairs. The hatch was open, so I went down without a second thought. Norrah asked from well above if she should bring clothes for tomorrow, and giggled. I said sure loud enough to reach her. She asked if I was in the basement: I said yeah. 
It looked pretty much the same down here. Exactly the same, actually. A few cups had changed positions, but that was from when the kids reappeared and took them up as if it had only been seconds instead of calendar days between sips. Having been twenty-four hours removed from the scene of yesterday, I absorbed what I saw more studiously. All the damned plastic cups. Really, those were the only sign that there was ever a party here, if you discount the banner and festoons. That and a couple empty bottles of gin and vodka; one bottle not empty, and Tom Collins mix. I went inside the bathroom, saw a Trojan wrapper in the trash-can atop a mound of wadded up tissue. Curiously there was a rubber beside it, still rolled up in a perfect circle. Maybe the lewd couple had second thoughts between opening the rubber and unraveling it, like If Im not mistaken, I seem to recall warm wet membranes feeling better than cold dry latex. Indeed, Conrad. I do believe youre on to something! I remembered seeing the couple come out of the crapper having just had sex, sex that spanned seven days. I wondered if when he reappeared after a fortnight stint in oblivion, if his erection was still hard. If he was inside her at the time, would he return with a water-logged weenie, much like swimming for prolonged periods turns your digits into prunes? Thats some long sex! I turned the bathroom light off and re-entered the room chuckling.
How did I not see it before? Against the back wall was the fireplace, a stone mantle and hearth. On the footing of the hearth was a hat. It was short and wide brimmed, black. I stepped to it and saw that there were horns on it, small ones, devil horns. I picked it up and saw that there was a mask behind it. I looked around the room and saw no other masks. Ostensibly the partiers took their disguises home with them last night. But not this reveler. Someone had left a hat behind, and a mask. It was porcelain, not some cheap deal bought at a discount-shop. It was heavy and thick, white and cold to the touch. It looked like the visage of a corpse, white and expressionless. It was of a man. A little color on the cheeks, but mostly just stark white. I discarded the hat and examined the mask. There was no stick attached to it for its owner to press it against his or her face. So that would mean it was one of those deals that was secured to the head by an elastic band. But there was no band, no string or slots for a string or anything of the sort. As though it were the face of a man-sized porcelain doll, its face surgically removed from the nose to forehead, eyes cut out, edges rounded smooth. How peculiar that it didnt have a strap or stick. How did the masquerader keep it to his or her face? I wondered if this belonged to number twenty-five. I didnt really wonder it, but I pretended that I didnt know the affirmative answer to this self-posed question. It was the mask of number-twenty-five. I knew it like I knew there was a good reason why Aaron wanted us to read the bible, and it had nothing to do with our salvation. Not that I knew the reason, I only knew there was one. The mask in my hands held the answers to every portentous question both asked and not asked, its wearer the key to the riddle, but it hadnt the avenue to share its secrets. He who wore it was responsible for Lake Arrowhead becoming a household name; he was responsible for the parents of two dozen youths worrying sick for six nights and seven days. He who wore it was responsible for the first gray hair of Norrahs thirty young years sprouting just above her left temple. Maybe by me touching it I was contaminating evidence. My prints would ruin the existing ones. That was doubtful, because detectives had already combed the place for clues a week ago. Theyd have already seen this thing and the hat. That left me to wonder: why were they still here? Wouldnt they have been placed in containers and tagged as evidence? They left them behind, really? I guess they may have deemed them irrelevant, as I might have done if I didnt know better. I only knew better because of what Aaron had told me. So I cut the detectives some slack and merely considered them lazy instead of stupid and lazy.
I had only touched the mask at the sides: maybe there were still prints on it. The odds of the mask having gone untouched since its owner last touched it seemed unlikely, but there could still be a partial print somewhere on it. Maybe the database would turn up a match not a police officer or myself. There wouldnt be prints on the hat, as it was fabric (unless the horns had prints; doubtful). I set the mask down where I had found it, and made a mental note to have a detective come take it, check it for prints. Unless Aaron counseled against it for some unknown reason, such as he already knew the identity of the man who had worn it.
What are you doing down here? Norrah asked from the top step, startling me. She jaunted down the steps. 
Ready to go?
Yeah. Someones mask, huh?
Yep, I said. And hat. Do you look painfully beautiful wearing anything and everything? And probably nothing? She wore contoured black cotton pants and a USC sweatshirt, her hair still down, make-up touched up.
You betcha.
I look pretty hot naked, myself, and under only one condition: the lights have to be off.
Luckily they make light-switches, then.
Yes, that invention is responsible for me getting laid.
Youre silly, she said and giggled.
Silly like a fox. Lets get out of here.
We went upstairs. I asked how long she planned on evading the journalists. They were salivating for an interview, and we both knew they wouldnt leave until they had their fill.
Soon, I think. It just seems kind of pointless, dont you think? I cant answer any of their questions, so why bother? If I knew more, maybe Id be more apt to give them their damned ratings.
Yeah, well hopefully those answers will come soon enough, with the help of Aaron.
She stopped at the answering machine to check messages. Unsurprisingly she had a gang of them, thirty-four messages. How many of them would be media begging for the first exclusive interview? Probably all of them. I said that to Norrah and she disagreed, bet that at least a few of them were from family, worried for her. She admitted to having avoided them for the most part. She had called her mom once, shortly after the nightmare began, but cut the conversation short when she burst into tears.
She pressed play and the first message was an NBC executive, using his name and title to get her attention. What got her attention more was his offer of a quarter-million dollars for an exclusive, stipulated on it being her first interview. I was pie-eyed, as was she.
Babe, you should seriously consider that, I said and swallowed dryly.
Now Im babe? Im a phone call away from being a quarter-millionaire and suddenly Im babe? She grinned wryly at me.
I laughed. What can I say? You look a lot hotter when youre about to become rich.
She laughed and said Id better be kidding, but knew I was.
But if youre going to give an interview, I reasoned, why not do one that pays?
It would leak that I did it for money, and people would form lousy opinions of me.
Lousier than the ones already formed? A lot of folks think you had something to do with them disappearing, as stupid as that sounds. Your continued silence projects guilt.
Screw those people then. I dont know, Ill consider it. I have to admit the idea of coming into that kind of money is a warm one. I could quit my job and focus on finishing my degree.
Heck yeah. Now were talking.
The next several messages were other producers, executives, celebrities of the news world, a few people who looked her number up in the White Pages. One message was from her mother, who worried for her daughter and implored her to pick up the phone. Norrah said that she must have given up leaving unreturned messages on her cell phone.
You shouldnt avoid your family, I said.
I spoke to her. I know what shell say and I dont want to hear it. Coincidentally shed say there would be people willing to pay me handsomely for an interview, so Id be foolish to turn them down. She doesnt care so much about my mental state, assumes all is fine now that the kids are back.
Not close with your parents, huh?
Eh, not so much lately. Theyre awfully selfish. Ive been in contact with Grandma, though. Shes the best. She worries for me.
The messages continued to play. She erased them one after the other, but didnt delete the one offering her a ton of cash. 
Norrah was just saying that she wasnt going to listen to the rest, that it would take an hour, when a message began playing that stole her attention. It was a girl calling herself Brittney Hayes, a name familiar to me. I suppose all twenty-three missing kids names would sound familiar to me, as Ive heard them mentioned more than once.
Hi, Norrah. My name is Brittney Hayes. I found your number in Yellow Book. I hope you dont mind me calling. Maybe youll remember me, I wore the red dress on Valentines Day, with the black cat mask. You let me in through the front door. Anyway, Ill understand if you dont want to call me back, but I was hoping we could get together to talk. Ill buy you lunch or something. My number is
What do you suppose she wants? I asked Norrah.
Probably the same thing everyone wants: answers. Answers I dont have. She was lovely, I remember her. Pretty dress, cute mask, charming girl. Maybe Ill take her up on the offer. Id like to ask her questions, too.

Chapter Seven

We were harassed again on the driveway. I laughed (inwardly) when Norrah haughtily said she was offered a quarter-million dollars for an interview, Can you beat that? There was no response, but the pair of journalists were visibly dejected. Stunning the bejesus out of me was when another journalist after brief consideration asked if shed give it to him for three-hundred grand. Norrah paused in stride only for a second, to process that offer, then continued on to my Tahoe by my side. 
As we idled past her nearest neighbors house, a man came outside the front door and flagged me to stop. I rolled down my window.
Evening, he said. Hi, Norrah. How you holding up, dear?
Fine, William. How about yourself? I saw you give an interview the other day.
Yeah, Ive given three. I dont know why they even bother, I dont know anything. All I could do is give character accounts of you, and I wanted to do that, for you.
I know, and thank you. You said really wonderful things about me. I appreciate that.
You bet. You deserve every nice thing I said. Youve been a great neighbor. So do you know anything that the rest of us dont, by chance?
No, sorry.
He nodded. I hope everything turns out for the best for you. You take care.
I pulled away smiling at the amicable man, waved at him. I recalled pulling him over a while back for not coming to a complete stop at a stop-sign. A California Stop, its termed. I wrote him a ticket for it; he accepted it like a champ. I felt like an asshole now. He came to the defense of my sweet Norrah, and how do I repay him? By writing him a hundred-and-fifty dollar ticket. Granted it was months ago, but the guilt was just as heavy. I resolved to give him a free pass on all traffic violations from now on. I had several people on that mental list, each more deserving than the last.
We motored along silently for a few minutes. There was black ice on the road. When I was a kid I remember people saying Beware of black ice, and Black ice is dangerous. I used to think they were saying black guys. They sound kind of the same. Beware of black guys. Im not racist so I had disagreed with those heads-ups.
I fishtailed a little here and there. I was accustomed to driving on it, so it didnt faze me. Its actually kind of fun to slide a bit, if you know what youre doing. Norrah unlatched her seatbelt and scooted toward me, butted up against the center console and put her arms around my shoulders awkwardly. I glanced over and saw a broad grin and smiling eyes. She reached in and kissed my cheek, then my ear, breathed in it, giving me goose bumps.
Tickles, I said. Arent you a sweetheart.
She touched my thigh and squeezed. I felt things stirring in my trousers.
I was thinking, she said. I think Im going to sell an interview. Ill have a lawyer write up a contract stating that the negotiated price must remain undisclosed. I dont want people thinking Im trying to profit from this. And with the money Ill quit my job. I think it would be great not only because I can take a bigger load of classes at school, but because we could spend more time together. Between your schedule and mine, we wont have much time together, you know?
I think its a fantastic idea.
She smiled and pecked an appreciative kiss on my cheek. Im glad you agree. And you know what else Ill do? Ill give ten percent of that check to Aarons church in Fresno. It would help me feel better about receiving that money. Did you see how hungry he was? I know it had nothing to do with his financial situation, or at least I dont think it did, but its not fair that a man so selfless as he, as virtuous as he, can hardly afford to eat out. Maybe the thirty grand or so given to his church would help him out. Dont you think?
I looked over at her, my eyes prickling. How in the world are you still single? You are such an amazing woman.
Single? Is that how you want me?
Well, no. I guess I mean how in the world were you still single.
Thats more like it, she said. You dont think were moving too fast, do you? It seems like we are, but I cant help it. Im only following my heart, thats all. I cant help it if it wants you.
You get sweeter by the sentence.
Im just being frank.
Howdy, Frank, pleased to make your acquaintance.
She slapped my shoulder and laughed.
I parked in my driveway apologizing for my house not being very tidy. It was an A-frame cabin, a cozy twelve-hundred square feet, one story with a loft. We entered my abode with her asking why I dont lock my door. Many people dont lock their doors in this community. Crime is all but non-existent, and my neighbors know Im a cop. I had long gotten into the habit of leaving my doors unlocked. It didnt seem unusual to me.
I have a bachelor pad, no articles of sophistication to be found. At least I didnt have posters of chicks in bikinis on my walls. And the empty keg of beer used as a TV stand had been upgraded to an entertainment center a year ago; I was thankful for having done that. I turned on some lamps. Norrah went to the restroom. I used the opportunity to tidy up real quick, put magazines and newspapers away and crammed a few dishes in the washer, pressed down the full trashcan so it didnt look overdue to be taken out. I uncorked a bottle of Pinot Noir as she came out of the restroom. I was pouring it into two glasses when her arms hugged around my waist from behind, hands folded together above my lap, her chin rested on the mantle of my left shoulder. What a sweet thing she is. I turned around and began a campaign of kisses. They grew more fevered by the second. I had filled the crotch of my pants and she noticed it, or at least suspected it, because she brought a hand between us, gave it an evaluative touch, and smiled. We took our glasses of red to the couch and recommenced kissing.
Theres something I need to tell you, she said between kisses.
What?
I have a penis. But dont worry, its small.
I burst into laughter. Well as long as its small!
It is. Its like yours.
I laughed harder. Gee thanks!
She smiled and went in for another kiss. It wasnt long before we had reached our limit of non-intercourse. Something had to give. It was starting to hurt, those dreaded blue-balls. I took a deep relieved breath when she stood from the couch, took my hand and led me to my bedroom in the loft. Oh thank God.
It was a torturous fifteen minutes in bed. I thought Id only last fifteen seconds, so at least there was that. But as it happened, only one of us had a happy ending and I felt just awful about it. Well I felt wonderful, but awful for her. She claimed not to care, and her smile was sincere.
We were lying naked on my down-comforter, hand in hand, staring up at the ceiling. After our breathing steadied, I asked when she might give that girl a call, Brittney.
Maybe in the morning. I think Im going to take the day off tomorrow. Maybe permanently like we talked about. I wouldnt mind having lunch with her before we have dinner with Aaron. Maybe Ill learn something useful from her.
I think her intention is to learn something useful from you.
Shes in for a disappointment then.
I wish I was off tomorrow. Id love to join you two.
We were supposed to start the bible tonight.
Oh yeah, I said. Did you really want to do that?
Not really, but we said we would. Lets do it over a couple glasses of wine. Well take turns reading aloud. What do you think?
Id rather employ a useful verse of the bible: be fruitful and multiply.
We already did that.
Lets go read.

*  *  *

Brittney lived with a roommate in the U of R dorms. She was the stereotypical starving student, but still offered to buy Norrah lunch. Norrah wouldnt think of it, said shed even drive down the hill to spare Brittney the trip at the gas pump, and they agreed to eat at a small diner close to campus. The girl who was decked out in red chiffon and hair styled like Nichole Kidman at the Oscars was now clad in jeans and a tee-shirt, lank ash blonde hair given no attention to, and makeup minimal. She was still a pretty young thing, as any girl with the name Brittney ought to be. Norrah was ten years her senior. They met in the reception area and shook hands. The hostess took two menus and said this way. They were being seated in a booth adjacent to an elderly couple. Norrah requested a booth with some privacy. Before those words, the hostess had looked at her as if she was trying to remember where they had once met. After Norrahs request of privacy, the lady connected the dots.
Youre Norrah Petersen, the woman said in an undertone.
Norrah gaped at her. How do you know?
TV.
Even though she hadnt interviewed yet, those damn cameras seemed to roll non-stop, so it wasnt all that surprising that her face had some recognition now. The two took a seat and gave their drink order.
Is it too late for breakfast? Norrah asked.
No, we serve it all day.
Norrah sensed the middle-aged hostess was wanting to get personal, ask some questions. But she didnt, and finally left.
How have you been? Norrah asked.
Eh.
I hear that, Norrah said sympathetically. How have you been treated? Lots of questioning? Are they sensitive at least?
I havent spoken with anyone since that night. Some were a little pissy with me, but not all of them. One treated me like I was keeping secrets from him. It irked me. I didnt know what the hell they were all talking about. I didnt believe anyone who said it was the 21st. Its not that I thought they were lying, I knew they were lying. I just couldnt understand why they would. It wasnt until I saw the date on a cell phone that I began believing it. I had been a missing person for a week. It blows my mind, really. A missing person for a week!
Yeah, its something, isnt it?
She nodded.
A moment later the waitress delivered two coffees and asked if theyd need a few more minutes. Norrah and Brittney were on the same page with wishing for privacy, and a prompt return of the waitress would violate that, so they got the meal order over with; both ordered pancakes.
Norrah stared at Brittneys delicate pallid throat. The girl needed some color. She had some color on February 14th, but only around her lower neck, blood red, and didnt have a head attached to her body. Was Brittney the headless girl whom Norrah saw in a red dress in the basement? She hadnt a doubt it was her. Brittney must have noticed Norrah staring at her throat, because she looked down to see what she was staring at.
This is going to sound like a stupid question, Norrah said, but on the 21st, when you returned, were you in any pain at all? Like have I dont know a headache?
Brittneys brow drew in. No, why?
No reason, Norrah said, looking away.
Is there anything at all you can tell me that would help me understand what happened? Brittney was pleading with her eyes.
Im sorry. You seem like a nice girl, so I feel a little guilty for accepting your invitation knowing that I couldnt provide you with any insight. I wish I could. It must be terrifying for you, knowing you vanished from existence for a week.
The young girl gazed somberly at the table, nodded once.
Norrah felt terrible for her, irrationally so. Maybe it was partly due to having witnessed the girl decapitated, if only for a second. On impulse she reached across the table and took the girls petite hand and squeezed it affectionately. The girl looked up sadly at Norrah.
Youre the only one Ive spoken to, Norrah said. The only kid who went missing, that is. I doubt there will be any others, so Im fortunate for this meeting. Maybe we could keep in touch? Id like that.
She nodded.
I promise Ill tell you whatever I learn. Okay, sweetie?
We wont learn anything, Brittney said.
Im not so sure about that. My boyfriend and I made friends with a man who also went missing. Oh yeah, I suppose you arent the only one Ive met with from that night. But hes different. Aaron. Hes older, and not part of your crowd. He crashed the party.
This intrigued Brittney. Oh yeah? Tell me.
There isnt much to tell. Yet, anyway. Im having dinner with him tonight, so Im hopeful hell tell me what he knows.
You swear youll keep me informed if he does?
I swear. Norrah let go of the girls hand. I dont want to violate his trust in me by telling you what Ive learned from him, so Ill ask him this evening if he minds if I share things with you.
Thank you.
This stays between you and me, right? Norrah said baitedly.
Of course it does. That was my intention from the onset of this meeting.
Good. Mine, too. Aaron, the guy who was at the masquerade party with you, he knew you all went missing before anyone had mentioned it. Or I should say he suspected it.
Brittneys eyes doubled. Really? How?
Like I said, Im hoping to learn a lot from him this evening. I have no idea how he knew.
Aaron Brittney said meditatively. I dont know the name. What was his mask?
I dont know.
Would you ask him for me? Was it a Frog?
I dont know, but Ill ask.
They didnt speak for a while. Brittney looked depressed, eyes low and heavy, brooding. She stirred her coffee mindlessly without pause. When she finally looked up at Norrah, there was moisture in her eyes, threatening to spill over. Ive been having nightmares, she said. Not your typical ones, either. I mean theyre something extraordinary. I get so relieved when I wake up and realize it didnt happen.
They started after the party?
She hummed an affirmative solemnly.
Since I promised to tell you what I learn, Norrah said, could you tell me what you know? Tell me everything, please.

Part 2:
Chapter Eight

So ya 
Thought ya 
Might like to go to the show.
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow.
Tell me is something eluding you sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you want to find out whats behind these cold eyes
Youll just have to claw your way through the disguise
In the Flesh?Pink Floyd

I always thought it would be cool to write a book, and I do love to write, but never imagined it would be like this. Im not even sure this is going to be a novel, but Jay Davis thinks it will. Youll have to understand that this is the first book Ive writtenor part of a book. I hope Jay finds a good editor. Grammar has never been my strong suit. Nor has spelling. But Im fairly intelligent and my vocabulary isnt too shabby. If you agree to look past these faults, then these following pages are for you, not to enjoy but to learn my side of things. Oh, that Pink Floyd song I prefaced the book with, let me explain that. That song came on the radio the other day and the lyrics gave me the chills. It could have been written by one of the twenty-three.
My name is Brittney Hayes. I turn twenty-one this November. Im a junior at the University of Redlands. I will be a dentist someday, God willing. If I can persevere through several more years of school, grad school and all that. I was born in Norway. My dad is an American, was in Norway for some convention on Global Climate Change, which he believes inI do not. Maybe there is some global climate change going on, but I hardly believe humans are responsible for it. Isnt that the height of hubris to think the human race has power enough to affect the climate of earth? The earth has been around for a billion years, I think it can survive whatever we throw at it. Sorry, I believe I got off topic. This is a hot-issue debate topic between my father and I, thats all. If he didnt preach to me all the time I wouldnt feel it necessary to defend my stance so rigorously. The fact of the matter is if he disbelieved in Global Warming, Id probably believe in it and argue with him still. Global climate change awareness was a new thing back then, and there were symposiums addressing the topic. It was at one such symposium that my dad had flown halfway around the world to attend, and there he met my mom Greta. She was a staff member at the hotel where the symposium was held. She spoke very little English, but spoke enough to get to know my dad better. He was in Norway for five days, and by the end of that five days my mom was pregnant. If Global Warming was as effective as my dads sperm, I believe wed all be cooked to death by now. My mom gave birth to me, and shortly after moved to the U.S., having accepted my dads proposal of marriage.
We lived in Los Angeles. My dad was rarely around, and Mom caught him cheating a few times. He can be an ass, my dad. But my mom is devoted to him, forgives him time and time again. My mom now works at the hotel Bonaventure, and has a managerial job. Between her income and my dads, they do very well. They both drive cars built in Germany that had price tags of six-figures. When I graduated high school my dad wanted me to go to USC, his alma matter. I chose U of R, and that didnt sit well with him. Mom was just happy I was continuing my education. He grudgingly agreed to pay my tuition and boarding. He said if I had gone to USC hed have given me a very comfortable allowance on top of that. But since Im obstinate and ignore what my dad wants and I have no clue whats best for me (obviously his words, not mine), he only gives me twenty dollars a week allowance. Twenty, that isnt a typo. My meal card and books and car insurance and all that is covered, so I dont need much money. But twenty bucks? I tried holding a job through my freshman year but it didnt work out so well. I was getting Cs, and Im an A student. So I quit and made do with my twenty bucks a week. 
I dont get to enjoy things like restaurant food, dont get to see new movies unless a guy takes me out on a date. Truth be told, I have accepted dates from guys just so I could get a break from mess-hall food and see a movie not on TV. My mom takes me clothes shopping once a year, so Im grateful for that. And she usually slips me some money behind my dads back. That money is always set aside for the gas pump.
So heres how my destiny came to be. One evening I was in my dorm room watching old re-runs of Will and Grace when my roommate Claire came in with a couple guys. One was her boyfriend Max, the other I didnt know. I was introduced to Jonathan, and had a few beers with the three. They were warm beers, but I didnt complain. From the beginning I knew Jonathan liked me. I dont say that with an air of conceitI dont think Im the hottest muffin in the traybut it was what it was. He stared at me unremittingly and was nervous in his speech. He isnt a bad looking guy, either. But the reason why I agreed to go out on a date with him had nothing to do with how he looked. During commercial breaks of Will and Grace they had been airing the same Outback steakhouse commercial time and time again, and that steak looked divine. It was a prime rib. I was hungry for one. When Jonathan nervously asked if Id like to see a movie with him that Saturday night, I said yes under the condition that he takes me to Outback first. I got my steak dinner, and whats more is I got to know Jonathan, and kind of liked him. Liked him as in I imagined him on top of me in bedsorry Mom, if youre reading this. At twenty Im still a virgin, if you can believe that, and Im not saying this in case my mom is indeed reading this; its the simple truth. Ive gone to third base with two boys, but the third-base coach hasnt yet waved anyone in to home plate. But that doesnt mean I dont fantasize about it, and frequently.
At the end of our first date, having just watched X-Men First Classthe Oppenheimer Theater downtown plays old movies for three bucks a ticketI let that rascal get to second base with me. In return I was allowed to put my hand down his pants. As if this were a favor to me and not him, right? I marvel at how they feel, so soft and curious, and wonder to how theyd feel in places not my hand. After we did that, he was eager to set another date with me, and I was pretty happy to have gotten a nice meal in me, and I wont deny I had a good time with him. Hes fun to look at, even if hes not the deepest guy, a little drab to shoot the breeze with. Hes nice and sweet and generous, so that earned him a second date. I considered myself fortunate to be the object of his affection.
Our second date was at Bullwinkles, an arcade and pizza place, with bumper boats and games. It was a lot of fun. He won me a stuffed bear which I didnt care for, but cared for the fervor in which he put in winning it. Over pizza he confided in me that he was a virgin. I couldnt believe it! I admitted to being one also. He said he wasnt one by choice. He was shy and hadnt gone on many dates. Here we found common ground, and formed a kind of bond. I thought there was a good chance that we might be each others first, and hed become my boyfriend. I also didnt think Id be marrying him, but in college ones vision of the future extends to about the weekend. Not Mr. Right but Mr. Right Now. That night he invited me to a party on the following Friday. I accepted.
That Friday we went to this much-anticipated party, a rager at a Frat house. There were kegs and hundreds of people. There was a gazebo in the back yard and after we consumed a few beers we staggered to it and enjoyed a little privacy, got to work exploring the others body. We were groping and kissing, really going to town, when another couple unaware of us came upon the gazebo.
Oh, sorry guys, the silhouette of a kid said.
Its okay, Jonathan said.
Is that you, Jonathan? The guy asked.
Yeah. Paul? Is that you?
Yep. Hows it going, bro?
I lowered my sweater that had been hiked up a little during the festivities, smoothed out my skirt, composed my fluttered self.
Good. Some party, huh?
Yep, Paul said. This is Lacie. Lacie, Jonathan.
She said hi, and my date introduced me to them.
Hey, do you know Taylor? Paul asked Jonathan. Taylor Labaucher?
Ive met him once. Why?
Hes having a masquerade party on Sunday, Valentines Day.
Oh yeah? Cool. You going?
Yeah, Lacie and I are going. You should come. You too, Brittney.
Jonathan looked at me: I smiled and shrugged gamely.
All right, man, Jonathan said. Wheres it at?
The mountains. Lake Arrowhead.
That far, huh? Will suck driving an hour home with a buzz.
Yeah, but you can get a room at Lake Arrowhead Inn. Kind of pricey, but I hear theyre nice.
You live up there, dont you?
Yeah, just a couple miles away from Taylors. Id offer to let you stay but its a small place. Besides, Lacie and I will want a little privacy, he said with a wink.
Youre such a perv, Lacie said and giggled.
I smiled at them.
Are you sure Taylor will be okay with us coming? Jonathan asked Paul.
Sure. Ill let him know tonight. Hes met you, it will be cool. The only thing is you have to dress up. Tux for you, formal dress for her. And you need masks.
I have a tux. Sweet, that sounds cool. You down, Brittney?
Sure. Sounds fun. Can we get a room at the hotel? Id rather not drink and drive in the mountains. And I cant afford to pitch in, Im poor white trash.
The three laughed at me. I had no shame in my economy. I wasnt going to pretend to have money when I didnt.
Moneys a little tight for me, too, but I think I can swing it. All right, Paul, count me in. Get me directions and a time, well be there.
Right on. Ill let you two get back to having fun. Paul directed at me: Make sure he wears a condom. That dude has all kinds of S.T.D.s. He and his date laughed. I laughed too; Jonathan flipped him off.
That would be pretty impressive if a virgin had S.T.D.s, I said.
Jonathan shot daggers at me with his eyes. Oops.
No way, youre a virgin? Paul marveled.
Yeah. Jonathan sighed.
Check back with him tomorrow, I said. You might find that hes become a man.
Jonathans eyes widened.
Yeah! Paul cheered. Atta boy. You two have fun. Be safe. Later.
The two walked off.
Thanks, Jonathan said to me.
Youre welcome.
Where did you want to have sex at?
In my vagina, I said, then laughed. He laughed too. Im kidding. I cant believe you asked me that. Im not really letting you have sex with me tonight. I was helping you out with your friend. You were right to thank me.
I see, he said glumly.
Oh cheer up. Just because you arent getting in my pants tonight doesnt mean you never will. Lake Arrowhead Inn sounds kind of nice. Maybe not a bad place for a couple of dumb kids to lose their virginity, huh?
Not at all, he said enthusiastically. Cool.
 The next day I visited my girlfriend Jenna. She was a student of U of R as well, had an apartment all to herself. I was jealous. She was about my size, a little more gifted in the breast department, but close enough that when I asked her if she still owned a prom dress, I figured on being able to fit inside it. She did have the dress, only it was in her bedroom at her parents house, some twenty minutes away. I told her why I needed it, and said if she got it for me, Id write a couple papers for her. Not that I was any smarter than Jenna, but Id get her a couple Bs (maybe an A or two) and she wouldnt have to earn them. She agreed to it. She admitted that she was going there anyway to have dinner with her parents. I then asked her if she knew of a place that sells masquerade masks. She didnt but thought it might be fun to make one. She is artsy like that. Shed help me out, go shopping with me at Michaels on Sunday (Valentines Day morning) and help me pick out the materials for it. She asked what I wanted to be. I said I didnt care.
How about a cat? We could get black velvet for the fur, some thick fishing line for whiskers.
That would be cool. All right. Thanks, Jenna, youre a lifesaver.
This party sounds fun. Maybe I could come?
Its invite only, I think. But Ill ask Jonathan. Hes only met the guy throwing the party once, a guy named Taylor Labaucher. Do you know him?
No. Oh well.
Dont forget the dress, I said with a grin. Oh, and what size shoe do you wear? Is that an eight?
She smirked. Yes. Is there anything else of mine youd like to have?
How about your ATM card and pin-number? I simpered at her.
You silly thing.
The stars were aligned, it seemed. Her dress fit me like a glove. Even though my boobs are a B-cup (tight in a B-cup, thank you), and shes a C-cup (not far from a D), she had bought the dress her junior year in high school, when her body closer resembled mine. I tried it on in front of her. She said since she couldnt fit into it anymore I might as well keep it. I was thrilled. When youre poor you can appreciate gifts like this. The red shoes, on the other hand, which matched the dress perfectly, did still fit her feet and those werent a gift but a loaner. I even went as far as borrowing her silver necklace and diamond earrings. Yes, folks, I was in debt to my friend for all this accommodation. Id be writing a few papers for her, at least. But I think she was doing it because she enjoyed it, and we were pretty good friends, had been since our junior year in high school. I was pretty excited that we decided to enroll in the same university.
She thought I looked too good in her dress to go to a masquerade party without my hair being done up just right. My hair is the same ash blonde as my Norwegian mothers. Very thick hair. When I get a trim most stylists make comments about it, usually something like Id kill for this hair. Im not a huge fan of being blonde. Id rather be brunette. I just like the way it looks, it has nothing to do with the stigma that is being a dumb blonde. But I do enjoy how thick it is.
Jenna had a friend who styled hair. Did I mention the stars aligned that Valentines Day? Shed arrange for her friend Michelle to meet me there at Jennas at four PM, to do my hair. I asked if shed dye my hair brunette. Jenna said I was a fool, that she wouldnt allow me to change my hair color.
It only took an hour for us to make the mask. It was mostly her making it. She has a talent for that kind of thing. It was a mask that I could see being sold at a high-end mask shop, if there were such things. It was cardboard, but she starched it to make it firm after she bent it to her design, and then adhered black velvet to it. She paper-mached a nose and put velvet on that, too. My words dont do it justice; it was great.
Jonathan knocked on my dorm room door at six PM. We both went slack-jawed at the others sight. Him in a tux and lion mask, me in my get-upMeow. After compliments were paid both ways, we got a move on, overnight bags in hand. He drove the same car that I drove, a Honda Civic, only mine was ten years old and blue and his was only a couple years old and black. He said there has been a change in venues, that the party wasnt going to be at Taylors after all, that it was going to be at Paul Kleins, the guy I met at the party the other night. I was disappointed at first, but when he said it was just a few miles down the road I felt good about it. I wanted snow, a romantic atmosphere, and Id get that in Lake Arrowhead.
We drove through Taco Bell on the way to our destination. I had my mask on during the first part of the drive, when it was just starting to become twilight. I liked it. Not just the way it looked, but the way the velvet felt against my skin. Sensual. On the freeway people were looking at me amusedly. We were driving beside an eighteen wheeler on Highway 30 and the truck driver looked down at me and smiled. I finger-waved at him. I couldnt believe it when he gestured me to pull down my dress bodice. I was agape, but then smiled. Im a sport.
Hey Jonathan, watch this.
He looked over at me and said, Whats up?
I turned a little in my seat to better face the trucker (away from my date), pulled the cups of my dress down. The look on the drivers face was priceless. Im lucky he didnt get in an accident and die. Or should I say hes lucky. His eyes were off the road for a good while.
Whoa, dont do that! Jonathan cried.
Why? My boobs were still exposed. I felt comfortable knowing the trucker couldnt see my face. I dont know why that is. Its not like hed know me even without a mask.
Because those are for me to see, not anyone else!
I dont belong to you, I said defiantly and took a hold of my breasts and squeezed them a little, slid my tongue across my upper lip provocatively. For a virgin I sure know how to have some fun, and can be quite inappropriate. Deliciously inappropriate.
Still! Put them away, please. Please?
Fine, I said and sighed. I shrugged at the truck driver who was still watching me acutely, lifted the cups over my dumb boobs. I decided to rile Jonathan further. Im going to pull my dress up for him. I feigned it, brought the skirt up to mid-thigh, with no intention of actually doing it.
Dont you dare!
I laughed, let go of my dress. Geez, youre so uptight. Theyre just boobs, you know. Every other person on earth has tits.
You were going to show him your other parts.
No I wasnt. I was teasing. But I bet that truck driver wont soon forget Valentines Day of this year. Doesnt that make you feel good, knowing we made someones day?
Not really.
Lighten up.
Well it kind of bothers me. You showed some stranger your boobs and I havent even seen them yet.
What?! You have too!
I have not! Ive felt them, thats different.
Well what you got was better. Be grateful.
I am. But still.
Would you like to see them now? I propositioned, hands at the ready on my bodice.
He looked to the cars driving all around us. There was one even with us at his left. No. That guy will see them.
Oh my  God. Youd pass on an opportunity to see my boobs for the first time if it means some stranger will also see them? Really, Jonathan?
He considered it momentarily, glanced at the car to his left once again. It was getting dark out, but not dark enough that people wouldnt be able to see my offering. 
Yeah, lets just wait till the hotel room.
I smiled devilishly and took hold of either cup of my dress and pulled them down, but only slightly. It was nothing you wouldnt see on broadcast television. But it was enough to elicit a gasp out of him, and he swerved a little before correcting his trajectory. I laughed and let go of my dress. Geez, Jonathan. What a prude. You need to get laid or something.
My thoughts exactly, he said and smiled.
You think youre getting in my pants tonight, dont you?
You said.
A girl has the right to change her mind.
A girl who has no qualms with flashing her boobs to passing motorists shouldnt be a girl who has qualms sleeping with a guy shes been dating.
Well thats probably the smartest argument Ive heard you make.
We both laughed.
You sure are slutty for a virgin, he said with his eyes on the road.
Yeah, Im a real slut, I said mockingly. Ive kept it in my pants for twenty years. I just might keep in there for another twenty.
He shook his head with a grin. Youre fun, Brittney. Im glad we got together.
I took a deep breath through my nose, felt pretty good about things, exhaled as I looked out my window to the truck driver who was driving beside us. He perpetually glanced down at me. I think he was hoping for an encore. Pervert. I flipped him off, but I suppose my grin negated the meanness of the act. He gestured me to flash him my tits again. I laughed. I rolled down my window, gestured him to do the same. He did.
What the hell are you doing now? Jonathan said waspishly.
Constraining my laughter I shouted at the truck driver, Show me your wiener!
He busted up. So did I. Even Jonathan loosened up a little and chuckled.
Come on, dude! I pursued. I bet you have a tiny pecker! Prove me wrong!
He shouted back at me, most of which was obscured by the wind of passage and a big engine at high RPM, but I think he said, Pull over and Ill do more than just show you it!
I wasnt laughing anymore. Okay, you just got a little creepy! Wouldnt you agree, Mr. Truck Driver?
He shrugged, a lewd grin boring down on me from his elevated seat.
I rolled up the window saying to Jonathan, What a pervert. Remind me not to show truck drivers my rack anymore.
I told you not to do it.
Oh eat me, I said and laughed.
Man, what a mouth you have.
I didnt curse.
Thats not what I meant.
Pfft. Thats not meant literally. Its a figure of speech. How much longer till were there?
We just left fifteen minutes ago!
I know but Im bored. I should have gotten a second bean burrito, Im still hungry.
I got something you can
Oh fuck off, I said and laughed all over again.
It was full dark when we reached the base of the mountain. The next twenty minutes were spent traversing severe winding roads at a steep incline. The temperature dropped from the fifties to the low thirties by the time we reached Lake Arrowhead. There were snow banks and trees flocked with white powder. It was pretty, even at night. The moon made the snow look a kind of smoke color, a bluish white. Jonathan turned the heat up, said we were almost there.
We turned off Highway 18 onto a smaller road. Ten minutes later we parked before Lake Arrowhead Inn. We carried our bags to the lobby. I made him put his lion mask on so I wouldnt feel weird wearing my cat mask. He whined that it was dumb for us to wear them just yet, but I didnt care. I was planning on having all kinds of fun tonight, so he would do best to oblige me. Im rarely the princess, but sometimes I am and when I am, you best accommodate me. I gave him a kiss immediately following my request for him to put the mask on, and that softened him up just enough.
You look very handsome, I said to him, and meant it. I scored a good looking boy in Jonathan, ladies and gentlemen.
We got our room key and went to our room. It smelled like Pine Sol inside. It was a large, nice room, a single king-sized bed. So this is where Ill be losing my virginity, I thought. He probably thought the same thing.
We sat our bags down and took a seat at the edge of the bed. He leaned in to kiss me. After the kiss he said we dont have to do this if I dont want.
Okay. Lets not.
Really? He sounded like a kid who finally didnt get his way.
I smiled. He gathered I was kidding, and I was. He asked if I wanted to get it over with before the party.
Get it over with? How romantic, I said sarcastically. No I dont want to get it over with. I want to enjoy it, and I wouldnt enjoy it just yet. We need to be in the mood, have a few drinks in us, and it needs to be the cap on a wonderful evening. Those are my conditions, like them or not.
All right, fair enough. We have about forty minutes to kill. Paul lives just a few miles from here. What should we do?
You can kiss me if youd like. If youd be so kind. You have welcoming lips.
Id like.
We passed the time kissing on the bed. It was shaping up to be a memorable evening.
On the short drive to Pauls, I asked how many people would be there: twenty or so. He thought hed only know a handful of people, tops. I wondered if theyd all be dressed as formally as us. He said they would. There would be plenty of free drinks, as well. I wanted him to keep an eye on me, not to let me get too drunk. Id like to remember this special evening, this magical evening (if I may be corny in telling you so). I had been looking forward to losing my virginity for a long time, I just wasnt in a hurry to do so. I certainly didnt want to have any regrets over doing it.
We parked at the end of a cul-de-sac, a street with few houses. Large properties, large homes. Giant pines everywhere. The difference between neighborhoods up here and those down the mountain is that your typical street up here is a quarter mile or so from the succeeding street, sometimes farther. In other words, trick or treating for the kiddos would be hell up here.
There were only a couple cars there, so we were one of the first to arrive. The street was pitch black. There are no street lights on the mountain. A single flood light illumined the porch. Together we knocked on the door, with our cat and lion masks donned, then rang. A nice-looking woman answered the door with a welcoming expression. I thought we had the wrong house at first. She was in her late twenties, I judgednot a college student.
Paul then appeared behind her, apologized, said he told everyone to go around the house to the back. We were sorry. Jonathan said he forgot about that. The lady assured us she didnt mind and let us in, said we had cute masks. I loved hearing it.
We went down the hatch to the bottom floor. It was only Paul and one other guy, who introduced himself as Phantom of the Opera. As his name implies, he wore a Phantom of the Opera half-mask. On the small table was a stack of red plastic Solo cups and a few fifths of gin and vodka, the good stuff, and some mixers such as tonic and Tom Collins. Beside the table was a large ice chest filled to capacity with dry hard ice. We put ice in cups and made a pair of gin and tonics. There was music playing, not loud yet, but it would slowly but surely get louder following each song that someone was fond of. Paul had a chair against the inner wall on one side of the chimney, and used a hammer and nail to tack up a banner that read Valentines Day Masquerade, 2013. It was written in fancy red cursive on glossy white paper. He nailed the other side up. There were festoons of red and pink hearts on all four walls. Phantom unzipped a large duffle bag and withdrew a strobe light, plugged it in. He tested it after shutting off the lights. The world was now in slow-motion. I danced a little, thrilled at the effects.
You go, girl, Phantom said impressively.
Dude, Jonathan said to Paul excitedly. Phantom killed the strobe and flipped the bedroom light switch back on. You know what this nut did on the drive over? He was thumb-pointing at me.
I rolled my eyes at him. Really, Jonathan? Why are men so hung up on boobs?
Dude, Jonathan said to Paul again, who was now smiling in anticipation of the story. She flashed a truck driver. It was hot.
It was hot? I said and cracked up. It was hot, was it? To Paul I said, You should have seen it, Paul. He acted like my father, scorned me like I was a naughty girl. I was just trying to have a little fun and brat here got all bent out of shape.
I do wish I was there, Paul said suggestively.
As do I, said Phantom and got to work mixing himself a drink.
It was so funny, man, Jonathan continued. Brittney rolled down her window and told the dude he has a little prick and prove her wrong.
Everyone was laughing except me. I folded my arms under my chest and rolled my eyes at Jonathan again. It was so funny, was it? I dont recall you laughing. Why must boys act one way when theyre alone with us, and another way around their buddies?
Its just the way dudes are, Paul Klein said. I think its awesome you did that. Youre a fun girl.
Thanks. I blushed.
So Paul said, his gaze jumping from my date to me. Did you guys put an end to Jonathans virginity the other night at the party?
It wasnt just my virginity, Jonathan said and thumbed me.
You, too? Phantom said, having closed the gap and now a part of a small circle of us center-room.
Yep. Me too, I said proudly. No we havent. Yet. Tonight, after the party.
You lucky dog, Phantom said to my date. It made me smile and feel wanted. Wish I were you tonight. 
Instead of being offended, my date nodded and grinned a smug one. Boys
So guys, Paul said off topic, there are two rules tonight: you must keep your masks on, and you cant ask anyone who they are. Your name has to be your mask. Thats Phantom, youre Lion, and youre Black Cat.
Wheres your mask? I asked him.
It dawned on him that he wasnt wearing his. He went to the dresser and took up a jester mask, secured it around his face. Im Jester.
Thanks for inviting us, I said to Paul. That was really nice of you. Im having fun already.
My pleasure. Ive been looking forward to this for months.
Only twenty people, huh? I said. Thats a small gathering.
Small equals intimate.
Anyone I know other than Brad and James? Jonathan asked Paul Klein.
Lacie will be here soon. But dude, what did I say about asking who people are? You might figure out who most of the people are, but you cant be asking people that.
Oh yeah. Sorry, bro.
Not a problem. Just be respectful of peoples right to disguise.
The back door opened, three people entered. One guy wore a showgirl type mask, the ones with colorful feathers and glitter and makeup. It was funny. Another guy wore an alien mask, a gray-man: big black eyes (from a material that is see-through) and shaped kind of like a praying mantis. The girl accompanying them wore a mask that was bird, little bits of yellow feathers glued to it, and there was a beak. Her dress was also yellow, only a lighter shade. Very pretty dress, strapless. I didnt think she was the girl Paul was with the other night, Lacie. This girl was shorter I think.
The rules were laid out to them, and they got to pouring drinks. One of the guys had brought a bottle of Cognac, some high-dollar bottle, and removed a pair of shot glasses from his tux coat pocket. When a Korn song played on the stereoit wasnt the radio, as there were gaps of silence between songs; probably a mixed CDPeacock turned the volume up. Alien gave him a thumbs-up gesture.
What a beautiful dress, Canary said to me.
Thank you. I was just thinking the same thing about yours. Exceptionally pretty. Extravagant.
Indeed, she said and giggled.
Indubitably, I said and smiled. Delighted, Im sure.
Yes, yes! Paul said to us. I mean Jester. Thats the spirit. Its a formal night, feel free to act like it, talk like it.
A minute later a boy and girl entered the back door. He was Mouse, a gray mouse, and she was Bunny. A white bunny. She was absolutely gorgeous. I wanted to be her. At least her body and jaw-line were gorgeous: I had to fill in the blanks where the mask was. This was turning out to be a party of exclusively pretty people. I felt honored to be a part of this class of people, a feeling amplified by our formal attire. Mouse and Bunny were hand in hand. Mouse produced a joint from his jacket pocket and brandished it.
Whos up for a little smoke? He said loudly and proudly.
Most were, but not me. Ill drink, sure, but thats about it.
They sparked it up and passed it. More people arrived. Pirate and Raggedy Andy. Then Leopard. Then Frog. And the best one yet: Elephant. Elephant was awesome. He wouldnt say who he was, as were the rules, but mentioned that he had an older sister who did makeup for movies. She used latex and other things to contrive that little mask. Like all the masks, it exposed his mouth, but what made his mask so damned cool was the trunk. It was functional even! It was flaccid like a limp penis, had two holes at the end. I laughed so hard I nearly peed myself when he took the lit joint and stuffed the end in one of the nostril holes and took a hit off of it that way. He exhaled smoke through his mouth and trunk! If there was a mask competition, hed have won hands down. 
I was on my second cup of gin and tonic, feeling pretty loose, pretty buzzed, pretty uninhibited. I thanked Jonathan on several occasions for inviting me to the party, each more slurred than the last. Batman was getting pretty friendly with Catwoman. They were a couple, Im sure. They were getting physical, kissing and lingering touches, and eventually groping. I couldnt believe she was rubbing him through his pants, for everyone to witness! I honestly thought they were going to have sex on the bed before the night was over. It wouldnt be long before they ventured into the bathroom for Batman to introduce Catwoman to Boy Wonder. Does Trojan make The Caped Crusader rubber?
It was getting crowded. The room was pretty big, far bigger than my shared dorm room, but it was looking small with all these people, and their fancy garb made them look somehow larger. But I liked it: crowded was cozy. There was a roaring fire in the fireplace that smelled as pleasant as it looked. And though I couldnt see it, there was snow just ten feet from where I stood. Again, cozy. The music was loud now. Conversations were loud out of necessity. My feet were beginning to ache due to me standing in uncomfortable shoes for nearly an hour, so I sat on the bed. Ahhhh. Lion sat beside me and we began making out. Wet kisses, masks pressing against one anothers.
There was a sudden outburst of bad mojo, but it was short-lived. The sophisticated yet jovial atmosphere wouldnt tolerate it. Zorro got chewed out by Paul Klein (excuse me, by Jester) when he sprinkled some powder from a tiny baggie on the table and began making lines. Cocaine or meth, I didnt know whichcocaine, probably. He was forced to put it away and not do that again or he could just leave the party. I was glad. It was a classy party and drugs dumbed it downalthough nobody had a problem with weed.
Without counting, there were around two-dozen people here now, and not a lot of room for potential late-arriving guests. I got a kick out of everyones masks. Some more than others. What a wonderful idea, this masquerade party was. Someone had said they have them every Valentines Day, only they vary in who hosts them. Id be hoping for an invite again next year.
I met eyes with a man seated in one of three chairs at the table. Frog. What captured my interest was that he wasnt interacting with anyone, hadnt been the few times I gandered at him. He should have masqueraded as a wolf, a lone wolf. He took a sip from his cup and looked away from me. Next time Id see him hed be standing in the corner of the room observing the party, seemingly detached from it.
Jester was standing with one foot on the hearth, swirling the contents of his red Solo cup, talking to Human. What else could I call him? Man? He wore a black tux, black shirt, black bow-tie, black hat, black gloves, and a black silk cape with a high collar. His mask was white porcelain, and was that of a man. There was a little pink on the cheeks, otherwise it was bone white. His hair, though hard to see from the hat, was dark. His eyes were dark, either brown or black. I thought he might have had black-colored contacts in as part of his costume. The red glow of the fire played on the right side of his white mask and jaw. What struck me as odd about him wasnt his attire. Everyone dressed to the nines, not just him. It was that his disguise was that of a man. I just noticed something else about his costume, and it had to do with his hat. He wore a short black hat with a wide brim low on his brow, and had attached a couple horns to it. Like devil horns, but they werent very big. I dont know how I missed them before. It was genius, if you ask me. In essence he was the devil masquerading as a man. Genius indeed. The devil hiding who he is? Yes, brilliant. Elephant man would still win first place, but Human would be a close second if it were I doing the judging.
Paul was palavering with him. More like palavering at him. Human didnt say anything that I could tell. He was watching all the denizens with apparent interest, slowly raking his eyes over the room, imbibing the details of the partiers. If people can be divided into two types, talkers and listeners, I judged he was the listener type. Listeners are generally good thinkers, too. At least thats my opinion.
Just then I felt Lions hand slide up the skirt of my dress. A cold hand against my warm thigh.
Nuh-uh, I chided. I sipped my drink leering at him. Id do best to keep an eye on this predator. He was a lion and I wasnt a black cat but a gazelle, his prey.
Come on, babe, he murmured in my ear. He then kissed that ear, wetted my lobe and breathed on it, giving me the chills. 
Ill be honest, it did things to me I havent before felt to that degree. Tingles in all kinds of great places. You cant touch me there in front of all these people, I whispered, enduring conflicting sensations of pleasure and embarrassment. 
His hand glided father up my thigh and didnt stop till he was at my underwear. They arent looking. And besides, they dont know who we are. Its a masquerade party. 
He began touching me in a way that sent torrents of pleasure to my intoxicated brain. Lets go back to the hotel room, I murmured, touched my cheek against his, closed my eyes.
Why? Arent you having fun here?
Very much so. But Im ready. Ready for it to happen. And Im happy its going to be with you.
Well leave soon, dont worry. Lets just enjoy ourselves a little while longer.
Between two songs was a small gap of silence, a gap made longer by the slow start of the succeeding song, Tools Aenema. At first the clamor of the crowd was intense, but they adjusted almost immediately, got quieter. Thats when we heard the pleasured sounds of a couple in the bathroom. Some laughed, some cheered. I smiled. Batman and Catwoman, I had no doubt.
See, Black Cat? Lion said. We can do whatever we like. Its acceptable here, and now. Nobody cares what we do.
I dont know, I whispered undecidedly in his ear. His hand touched me where I wanted it to touch me, and reflexively my legs unhinged a little, opened up like a Venus fly trap looking for dinner. It was an involuntary action brought on by immense pleasure. We kissed. 
Mmm, he hummed, youre smooth.
I didnt think he was referring to my legs because he wasnt touching them. Tool was loud, but now that I knew what to listen for, I could still hear Batman plowing into Catwoman, their grunts and moans. I succumbed to the moment just as they had, couldnt fight it any longer, didnt want to fight it any longer. I was feeling too good to do anything but gladly receive Lions offering. As he became more diligent with his digits, he ceased kissing me to better focus on his efforts. My bleary eyes were narrow slits as I wallowed in ecstasy. I probably wasnt drooling, but if I had been I wouldnt be surprised. Everything before me was a blur of masqueraders, movement streaking from side to side. Laughter, pot-smokers coughing, anecdotes being hacked at, someone whistled for whatever reason. I heard the door open and close often, and smelled cigarette smoke. I leaned back just a little against a propped arm, legs opened slightly more, driving the skirt of my dress up above my knees. Not that anyone was watching what was happening, but they surely could have if they wished to. And at that moment I wouldnt care if everyone present had a clear view of my dates antics, because I had lost the battle moments ago, was riding this euphoric wave both unwillingly and oh-so willingly. 
My body tingled all over. Pulsations of deep warm pleasure radiated from my center outward, pervading the whole of me, and progressively it got worse, and by worse I mean it got better. 
I had an unobstructed view of Human. I met eyes with him. His: wide and piercing, alight from the nearby fire. Mine: narrow and lazy. He looked down to my lap and perceived what was being done to me. Hell, maybe he saw what was being done to me. It had become an act of exhibitionism in its most natural form, if such a thing can be said. From his powerful jaw, lips stretched a wry grin slowly. By degrees it grew until his lips parted, his grin wide enough to bare his yellowish teeth. His eyes returned to mine. His smile was broad, and dare I say charming?but his eyes his eyes were cold and excited, and more than anything they were penetrating. Unlike his mouth, his eyes werent smiling behind that man-mask.
He winked at me.
Through no will of my own, my legs widened to the point that my skirt slid up very high on my bare thighs; my left knee that had been pressing into Jonathans leg was now over his leg to accommodate my wide angle. I couldnt help it, didnt want to help it. I was completely powerless over my oppressor the Lion.
I was so exposed that I felt the ambient air between my legs. I had reached the point of no return. I was escalating, climaxing, and nothing on earth could prevent it from happening. I began convulsing, leaned back farther against my now-two locked arms. Lion put his mouth on mine, impeding my view of Human, disrupting our mutual fixation. I backed my mouth from his, ducked around him, regained eye-contact with Human, much as iron cant help but be drawn to a magnet. My legs and privates seemed to be their own entity independent of meunder the spell of Lion, governed by Lionas were my eyes, only they were being governed by him. Governed by Devil. Thats who he was: Devil. Not Man. His wide toothy grin, horned head, round unsmiling eyes feverishly boring into my own behind a mask that wasnt fooling me; an excited reveler relishing the slaughter of the gazelle by Lion. I was being taken in body by beast, and taken in mind by Devil. 
I came, an explosion discharging every neuron in my body in a quaking finale. My breath hitched, eyes squinted shut as I endured the cataclysmic bliss of an orgasm. 
Lions paw left my drained body, the aftermath of my orgasm seeping out of me like a tipped-over jar of honey; my legs twitched like the last few spasms of a rabbit snared in a bear-trap. He pushed my legs closer together without assistance or resistance from me, tugged my dress down to my knees. I opened my eyes slowly. Devil had left. I looked around: he was gone. So was Jester, actually. How long had my eyes been closed, a few seconds? Longer? Time is funny that way when youre drowning in sensory overload. 
Did you enjoy that, Black Cat? Lion asked with a slanted grin.
Uh-huh. So much. I swept my drowsy gaze across the room. I felt sticky and dirty. Id be taking a shower before making love with Jonathan at the hotel.
What are you looking for?
Nothing.
Can I get you a new drink?
Please.
Be right back, Lion said and got off the bed.
I reached under my dress and returned the front of my panties back to where they belonged, awed at how much wetness there wascould all this really have come from me?gazed around to see if anyone was watching me. Like it mattered. Seconds ago everyone had front seats to the show of the night. Perhaps if there wasnt a door on the bathroom, that would have been the show of the night. But there was a bathroom door, so it was I who was on display for any number of discerning masqueraders. But had I been? Devil saw, that much I did know. Those fire-reflecting unsmiling eyes and hungry smile were testament to that. I could scarcely believe I just got molested in front of twenty-something people. Okay, so it was consensual molestation, but still. That damned Lion. Maybe I should have been Gazelle tonight. Maybe I was being uptight. Its a party, I should embrace my sexuality and champion experimentation. Everyone says college is a time for experimentation, so I shouldnt feel bad about what happened. And nobody was even glancing at me. Its not like people were cat-calling me and whistling, clapping and begging for an encore. If others didnt care, why should I? Maybe Lion knew what he was doing all along. He had already proven on the drive over that he disliked strangers observing my bare body, so surely he wouldnt want strangers (or acquaintances) seeing my more intimate anatomy. I couldnt even be a hundred-percent sure that things happened as I described them. Or fifty percent. It was a fine haze I had drifted into, from equal parts gin and pleasure. Awful dreamlike it had been.
Ice chest sucks, Lion said upon returning to me. He handed me a cup with clear liquid. No ice inside. Ice melted already. Its just a chest of tepid water. How could that be? There were ice cubes in it like a half-hour ago. Oh well.
Suddenly the hatch over the downstairs portal thrust open. A womans legs were what I saw first, then the woman who they belonged to: the nice lady from upstairs. She hauled ass down the stairs frenetically, followed by a man. The womans eyes were goggling, pure terror broadcasting from them. Once she reached the bottom landing her legs buckled and the man caught her before she hit the floor. She was unconscious. He looked at the sum of us with mingled awe and terror. Such was the profundity of their emotion that several people directed their attentions to them. Pirate turned the volume down on the stereo just a little. The man turned the woman over on her back on the carpeted floor.
Whats happening? I asked Lion.
He shrugged, both our gazes on the couple from upstairs.
Wheres Jester? I asked. Did you see where he went?
No. I dont know, babe.
Batman and Catwoman came out of the bathroom; he zipped up his trousers. There was now a small gathering of people around the upstairs woman and man. He was on his cell phone, and after he ended the call he told us the cops were on the way and we were being detained, and that he was a cop as well. That changed the dynamic of the party at once. The music was turned off. The air turned heavy, solemnity and confusion replaced mirth. Nobody seemed to be drunk anymore, which wasnt surprising because I myself felt perfectly sober, and I felt that way because of the gravity of the moment. Phantom and Peacock pleaded with the self-proclaimed cop to call off the inbound cops.
I was scared. Confusion breeds fear, and I was one confused girl. The woman began stirring; that was a slight relief. I had wondered if something tragic was occurring to her. Possibilities cycled in my mind, such as the man who had formed lines of coke on the table had gotten us busted somehow. Were we doing anything illegal down here? Underaged drinking, I supposed, but is that really a matter of police involvement when its done inside the sanctuary that is a home? The fact of the matter is that cops were coming and we were being detained, which is a polite way of saying under arrest, and since I couldnt point the finger of blame at any specific individual with any confidence, that left me as an equally guilty party. That meant I was under arrest. I was in deep shit. My mom and dad oh man, I was going to get in trouble. They could cut off funding to my education or dorms or both. But what exactly had I done? It felt mischievous what I had gotten into with Lion, our little act of exhibitionism, but was that really something to get in trouble with the police over?
It was quiet. Those who did speak did so in a solemn whisper. The exception was the woman from upstairs and her friend. She was demanding to know where wed been for the last seven days, and that was as nonsensical as anything. Her friend doubled up on her question, shouted at us to confess where the hell weve been for seven damned days. I was growing more scared by the second. I wrapped my arm around Jonathans, leaned into him.
Im afraid, I whispered to him.
Itll be all right, he consoled. Its just a misunderstanding.
I hope so.
I heard sirens in the distance, making this dreamlike encounter feel more like a situation, a grave one.
My date hummed meditatively, his gaze focused on the hearth.
What? I said.
Thats odd.
What is?
Look at the fire.
There wasnt a fire. Just ash. But only minutes ago there had been a big fire. A big fire with a wonderful aroma that was now gone entirely. It was odd but I reserved hope in there being a logical explanation for it. Someone doused it with water, that was probably iteven though there was no smoke or vapor or reason to have extinguished it.
Would someone tell me where youve fucking been over the last week! The woman shouted, jumping from one scared confused countenance to the next.
What do you mean? Phantom said, and it was the first time I heard him sound that way. A new tone, one of skepticism and self-doubt.
I mean, you all disappear last week and now youre all back? Whats going on here!
I hugged tighter Jonathan, closed my eyes. I want to go home now, I murmured to him. Please, Ill do anything in the world for you if you just please take me home now.
We will soon enough.
His voice was distant, detached. He was ruminating, musing. Part of me wondered what over, but a larger part wished not to know. The scared part.
Ice chests cant break, he whispered to me. Insulation doesnt break. The ice in there is now room-temperature water.
I dont want to hear that, I said and put my closed eyes against his jacketed shoulder.
And the fire, he said. Wheres Paul? He repeated the question louder, for the masqueraders to hear. Wheres Paul, guys?
Pirate brushed by the woman and cop and took to the stairs.
Where do you think youre going? The cop asked him.
To get Paul.
Paul isnt here.
Hes not? Whered he go? He was still going up the stairs.
He moved out of here a week ago, hasnt been back since. Kid, why dont you come back down here. Nobody is to leave till I say they can. Got it? I mean it, Im detaining each and every one of you for the time being. Dont worry, nobody is in trouble.
Then why are you detaining us! Jonathan said crossly.
Because Im a cop and I have that authority. Just settle down, its going to be a long night. If you all have cell phones on you, I suggest you call your parents and let them know youve returned safely.
Nobody did, though. Nobody considered themselves to be missing. The guy was loony, as was the lady from upstairs. But my intuition said that they werent. Ice gone, fire gone, Paul long gone. Those were bad realizations. Bad things to consider.
I turned over and laid down flat on my stomach, face down on the comforter and began crying. Jonathan was a sweetheart, rubbing my back to comfort me. I needed comfort. I turned my head to keep an eye on the cop. I didnt trust him. He was responsible for all this happening, shared culpability with the woman. I watched as Frog approached the cop and leaned to him, said something in private to him. The off-duty cop looked stupefied by what he heard from Frog. Frog grinned at him. Grinned at him!
Im so scared, Jonathan, I said. Something bad happened, cant you sense it?
Yes, he said flatly, distantly. Yes, I do.

Chapter Nine

Uniformed and non-uniformed police officers and Sheriffs deputies arrived via the back door and stairs. It was too crowded, so they singled out some masqueraders and escorted them upstairs to begin their inquisition. I remained downstairs, with my Jonathan. I had gotten him to lay down beside me on the bed, and we embraced, face to face. There were many individual conversations going on at once, all somewhat quiet, and were between cops and masqueraders. It would be our turn soon enough, I figured. A girl in a black dress went inside the bathroom holding her stomach, closed the door behind her. A second later I heard her vomiting. Maybe from the alcohol, but probably from the assertions a cop made to her just moments prior.
I should be losing my virginity right now, I said to Jonathan.
It filled me with appreciation when he smiled at that. His smile was a pillar of strength in which I sought purchase. He apologized to me, said the nights young, though we knew damn well that sex wasnt something that wed be enjoying this night.
After having been questioned, Frog stepped away from a uniformed cop and looked around, contemplating where he wanted to take a seat, and decided hed take one on the bed. He sat a foot or so behind me, back to back. I rolled over and tapped his shoulder. He glanced back apathetically, but that indifferent expression changed at my sight. His brow lowered a little, features softened, a kind of sadness pervaded him merely at my sight. More than sadness, it was a disapproving expression.
Excuse me, I said, but what questions did the policeman ask you?
He looked at Jonathan with that same disapproving expression before returning his gaze at me. Where weve been over the last week.
Why do people keep saying that? Why does it matter where weve been?
Do you have a cell phone? He asked me.
Yes, why?
Take a look at it, at the date.
I couldnt remember where my purse was, then remembered I left it in Lions Civic. I said I didnt have it on me. Jonathan fished his phone from his pocket and pressed a button, triggering a glow on the screen. What the fuck he breathed, and turned the phone around, showed me. 9:16 PM, and under that, February 21.
Its just broken is all, I said.
No it isnt, Frog argued. Everyones phone will read the same date. Weve been here for a week.
I felt like I was going insane. I knew we hadnt been here for a week, yet people adamantly insisted we had. It was maddening. 
Why arent you scared or confused then? I said pointedly to Frog. I think my question caught him off guard. He had been looking a little too confident, a little haughty before I sprang that question on him. You seem to be the only masquerader here who has a grasp on things. 
I reached down and hiked my dress up to the knee, grazed my calf: smooth freshly-shaven skin. Wasnt that proof if nothing else that we hadnt been here a week?
Here, touch my leg, I said to Frog. Feel it. Its smooth. No stubble at all.
Im not touching you, Frog said with marked disdain.
If you believe weve been here for a week, why are my legs smooth? And why dont you have a beard?
I couldnt say.
And why arent you acting as shocked and perplexed as the rest of us?
I am, he said, but it was bullshit. He was lying.
Youre lying. Youre a liar.
Frog lowered his voice and said with equal parts fervor and contempt, You should consider yourself blessed, young lady. Blessed! Blessed that you lived to see this day. Because if you had died, your Lion friend here would have an eternity to finger you before an audience in hell.
I was stunned. And utterly ashamed. I think Jonathan was ashamed as well; he didnt appear to be angry.
I I didnt know anyone saw that, I said in a tiny voice.
You didnt know or you didnt care? People did see it. Your parents should be proud of you, he said sarcastically.
I covered my face and wept, feeling ashamed and despising my selfishness.
Frog touched my shoulder: it startled me. Im sorry, he said sincerely. That was wrong of me to say.
Im such a sh-shit, I stammered, and sobbed. Im so sorry.
Sweetheart, its okay, Jonathan said soothingly.
Frog ran his hand through my hair. I uncovered my face and met eyes with him. His eyes were glassy. I looked away from him in my shame. 
Be remorseful, Frog said, be contrite, ask God for forgiveness, but dont hate yourself. Youre a beautiful girl. I can see that in you. Look at me. You made a mistake, thats all. God loves you.
He does not, I said and sobbed. Why should He?
He does. Thats why youre weeping here right now, and not... gone.
Is everything all right here? A cop said from the foot of the bed.
Yes, sir, Frog said.
Would you give us a moment alone? The cop said to Frog.
Frog caressed my cheek with a sympathetic smile, apologized again before getting up and relocating to the other side of the room. The cop took his place on the bed, turned the scrawled-on yellow page of his little notepad over to a fresh sheet. He asked if we preferred to be questioned together, me and Jonathan, sensing that we were a couple. I said yes please, and thanked him. I had stopped sobbing, but the tears were running unchecked.
Please state your first and last names. We gave our names: he jotted them down. Give me the details of the seven days prior to today, the cop directed at Jonathan.
It was an ordinary week. Classes, went to a party on Friday night. Watched college basketball most of the day yesterday, and went to this party tonight.
The cop jotted a short note before saying, I should be more specific. Could you give me the details of the week spanning from February fourteenth till today?
Is it really the twenty-first? I asked him.
He nodded gravely, wrote another short note. He already knew we wouldnt have answers for him. The last person or two questioned had already cemented that expectation. But he had a job to do, and he executed it professionally.
Then we have nothing to tell you, Jonathan said. We got here Valentines Day evening, and as far as we know, its still that day.
Is it possible that someone slipped something inside your drinks? The cop speculated. Drugged you all?
Lion and I exchanged doubtful stares, shrugged. I suppose its possible, Jonathan said, though highly unlikely. There are no lapses in my memory.
Mine either.
The cop nodded, wrote a few words down. Nor is there a lapse in anyones memory here, it seems. Do either of you have any enemies?
We said no.
Whats your relationship like with Norrah Petersen and Paul Klein?
Neither of us knew Norrah, and I had only just met Paul on Friday; Jonathan said he was acquaintances with Paul.
The cop jotted on his pad. In your opinion, would Paul have any reason to abduct anyone? Or have the disposition of someone who might do so?
No way, Jonathan said.
The cop turned the page over and stood up. You have my deepest sympathies for going through this. I know I dont look it, but Im thrilled that youre alive and well. If theres anything you remember about this past week, or think of something youd like to share with me, heres my card. He handed us each one. Soon youll be free to go. Since most of you live on campus in Redlands, were going to have a bus come and transport you all thereif you wish to accept that service, that is.
My car is on the street, Jonathan said.
Im afraid they impounded the cars on the street several days ago. They were considered possible evidence in your disappearances. Im sorry.
It wasnt much longer that we were detained there. When a bus pulled up out front, we exited through the front door in a single and double ranked file toward it. A police barricade separated the journalists from us. It was daylight out front, though the clock would have you believe it was dead-night. A hundred feet away camera crews had their big ass lights on stands and they cut through the darkness like a hot knife through butter. That and the swirling blue and red cop lights and blindingly bright headlights. I squinted as I walked.
None of us said anything as we situated ourselves on the bus. We were collectively despondent and introspective. Our minds were anchored down to the sobering reality that we were part of a dark mystery that might forever remain unsolved. Nothing good would ever come of it, but there might be some bad. 
Together we lost a week of our lives, somehow, and that knowledge was likely to plague our speculative minds for the remainder of our years. These people who were mostly strangers to me and strangers to each other, would now recommence our lives as twenty-three individual fragments of a larger picture all our own. We were bonded by a profound commonality that would never change, never diminish. 
Twenty-three people who went missing we were. But not a one of us on that bus was smiling a toothy grin with wide unsmiling eyes, wearing a mask of a man. Paul Klein wasnt the only one who escaped that night.
In the coming days Id be all-consumed by the need for answers. Who could I talk to? The lady from upstairs and her friend the cop stood out as likely candidates. When I wasnt awake to ruminate over the mystery, I was sleeping and suffering the worst nightmares of my life. Id wake my roommate Claire with my screaming. After the second night of that she began sleeping at her boyfriends, assured me that it wasnt personal and that shed come back once I settled down.
I dont feel it is important to elaborate on the content of my recurring nightmares, as dreams are just dreams. They dont pertain to these pages. And if they do, I dont want to know about it. What I will tell you is that it is the same dream every night, and is of the masquerade party. Something inhuman gets to work slaying us all, one at a time, and with great pleasure. The door is unlocked but wont open for us as we try to escape. The hatch upstairs wont budge either. One by one we are murdered, not methodically but in a kind of homicidal improvisation. 
I awaken each time upon my death. Clawed hands ripping through my neck.
If you have any ideas or information for me regarding what Ive written, no matter how insignificant you might think it is, please contact me at brittneyHayes951@gmail.
 Thank you.

Chapter Ten

Norrah felt so bad for Brittney by the end of their pancake meal that she not only swore shed get back to her as soon as she met with Aaron, but opened her wallet and removed all the cash she had (a few twenties and some smaller bills) and insisted she take it. Compensation for your time with me, Norrah had said. Brittney abashedly took the money, said if she didnt need it so badly shed have turned it down. 
Norrah had a good idea that she (Norrah) would be selling an interview for a ton of money. And if so, she considered cutting the girl a check for some unknown quantity, to make her remaining college years more comfortable to get through. What a shitty father she has, to make life so rough on his daughter as he drives around a hundred-thousand-dollar Benz. And what a shame that a fortune was so accessible to Norrah but not for Brittney. Any news broadcaster should want to hear her story over Norrahs. But what it came down to is there were twenty-three people who went missing, so the public couldnt and didnt remember each of their names. NBC couldnt hook Interview with Brittney Hayes tonight at eight! because nobody would know who that is. But everyone knew who Norrah Petersen was. She was the closed-door and whispered prime suspect at first, sharing that infamous title with Paul Klein. She knows something that she isnt telling, many pundits had echoed for days. It didnt help that people associated the surname Petersen with Scott Peterson, who had killed his wife and unborn child; that story was in the headlines for months. So all the public had to do was transition from hating one Peterson to the next.
Had it been only Brittney Hayes who went missing, and twenty-three people shared Norrahs circumstance of being upstairs when it happened, the money would have been offered to Brittney instead. But it wasnt just that. Several students had already given interviews and did so for free, so there wasnt enough meat on that bone left for news companies to make a business proposition to yet another recovered student. And on top of that, the interviews with the students were boring, a real yawn-fest. Sure the ratings would have been high for the first and maybe second interviews, but people had given up hope of hearing something juicy after having heard variations of, I have no idea what happened. I didnt know I was missing. There is nothing unusual to speak of.
Norrah walked her new friend to her Civic. Friend is what Brittney was; Norrah had decided that before her first pancake was eaten. She enjoyed the girls personality and they shared something special in an indirect way. She especially liked her candor. Things she should have been embarrassed about or ashamed of she easily confessed to. Thats a rare thing. And a refreshing thing. She described in too much detail (Norrah thought) the sexual things. Norrah figured she could ask Brittney anything and get an honest answer back reflexively, without any consideration or tailoring. And she did just that, at the Civic.
Are you still a virgin then? Norrah said with a silly smile.
Unfortunately, yes. Why, you want to get lucky?
Norrah laughed out loud. No, weirdo. Thats really cool. Dont feel like you need to get it over with. You shouldnt feel bad waiting till the time is right, and with the right person. I wish I had done what youre doing.
Yeah. She unlocked her car door and sat inside. Im kind of glad it didnt happen, because I would be regretting it right now. Since that night, Jonathan has avoided me. Maybe hell come around, but it isnt looking like it right now.
Have you had any long-term boyfriends?
No. If I had, I probably wouldnt be a virgin.
Oh yeah, duh.
Every time I date a guy something seems to screw it up. I guess Im the one to blame. But not always.
Do you want to hang out sometime? Come over for dinner? I know its a long drive, but Id pay for your gas.
Sure.
I admit to having a kind of ulterior motive. I do like you, and Id enjoy spending time with you, just the two of us, but theres a guy Id like you to meet. The guy Im dating, the cop who was with me that night, he has a younger brother about your age. I havent met him yet but Jay tells me wonderful things about him. Ive seen his picture, hes really good looking. And he just dumped his girlfriend who cheated on him. Whod want to cheat on a guy like that? Shoot, dont tell Jay I said that. His name is Caleb. He goes to U.C.L.A.
Brittney smiled at Norrah, closed her door and lowered the window. Thats cool of you to want to do something nice for me, a virtual stranger. Oftentimes first impressions are wrong, but I was right to think you were a nice lady when I first saw you.
Lady? Norrah repeated with a sour taste in her mouth. Im a lady to you?
Sorry, I know that sounds like Im calling you old. Girl. Is that better?
Much.
How old are you, anyway? Mid-twenties?
Norrah liked hearing that. Thirty. Thanks.
About Caleb: dating isnt something Im eager to do right now.
Not now, but down the road. But not too far down the road because a guy like him will have women coming after him.
All right. Thanks for the money. I feel like a shit taking it. I hope it doesnt set you back too much.
Not at all, Norrah lied. It did sting. Take care, Brittney. Ill call you tonight, okay? After Aaron leaves.
I look forward to it.
On the drive back up the mountain, the low-gas light blinked on in Norrahs Camry. She stopped at the Chevron in Blue Jay. She began pumping gas after swiping her debit card in the thingy. After four dollars of petro went inside the hungry tank, the gas stopped. She tried it again, but it wouldnt let her pump. She wondered if she was at zero in her checking account. There was a strong possibility she was. Shed have to check her account online when she returned home. She went inside the Food Mart and handed the clerk her debit card and said forty on pump two, and added that it might not work. He punched some keys on the register, looked up at her with sudden awareness.
Norrah Petersen, he said.
Yes?
Youre her.
Uh thanks?
Thats so cool. He checked to be sure nobody was within ear-shot when he said conspiratorially, Between you and me, Paul Klein had something to do with all them kids missing, didnt he?
Norrah stole the debit card out of his hand and left.
I didnt mean any offense by it, the clerk said to her back.
Nobody ever does, she said.
Thanks to the ridiculous prices at the pump, she only got one gallon of go-juice for the remaining four bucks in her account. Shed have to get gas at Shell, on credit. Shit, her Visa was currently at its max of two grand. And if she wasnt maxed on credit, would someone at Shell make comments about her celebrity as well? She couldnt write-off every gas station. And every bank. And store. Maybe giving that interview would be a blessing on two fronts. Money, and people would stop asking questions. All the questions would have already been asked, and answered. Theyd still ask questions, but then she could just say Watch the interview on YouTube, and that would be the end of it.
She considered bringing me in on the business deal. Maybe shed counter their offer with a half-million, and say Jay Davis would join in. Theyd probably wonder who Jay Davis is, and when she stated that Im the only other person who was in the house when the twenty-three reappeared, theyd imagine their ratings hiking north. With a half-million, we could both retire. Share her nearly-paid-off house and live off of the interest. If that dried up, theres always a book deal. Like the book Im writing at this very moment. There has been no publisher-shopping for this story yet, and truth be told Id rather not make money on this project. Once I make a dime off of it, people will see that as a motive for writing it. Or that Im trying to profit off of others misfortune. Id rather find a way to get the story out there while keeping it non-profit. I suppose thats my ultimate goal.
As Norrah drove home she wondered how she ran out of money. She knew she was low, but not that low. She was getting paid tomorrow, so it wasnt a big deal.
Shit. Shit! She was supposed to buy groceries for tonights hosted dinner. Rib-eye steaks. Now what? As much as she liked Brittney, she currently resented her for accepting that sixty-something dollars earlier. Thats unfair, Norrah thought. It wasnt Brittneys fault but her own. She considered calling me to ask if Id buy some meat and bring it over, but couldnt get herself to do it. She was fiercely independent, and didnt think she had it in her to ask that favor.
She was friendly with Clyde the butcher at Jansens Market. He was in his sixties and always flirted innocently with her. They had been acquaintances for ten years. That was plenty long enough to ask him for a huge favor: let me pay for the steaks tomorrow with interest. She was confident hed go for it.
She wanted to get it out of the way so she wouldnt have to worry about it over the next several hours. She parked outside Jansens and didnt get a hand-cart as she entered. Shed rather not be presumptuous with Clydes generosity. She was already changing her habits, not looking around as she entered the store but instead kept her head down and eyes straight. It was dead at this hour, thankfully. She frowned at the butcher behind the counter, not Clyde.
Afternoon, maam, the man said affably. His nameplate read Ryan Sturgeon.
Hi, Ryan. Is Clyde off today?
No, hes in back cutting up some lamb. Want me to get him?
Please.
He went in the back. Clyde came out a moment later with a bloody apron and a very large knife. He smiled at her. Norrah! Well hello there, lovely lady.
She wished he hadnt used her name so loudly. Hello, kind sir. How are you today?
Cant complain, cant complain. You look great.
Do I? She looked at herself. Whatever you say. Hows Bethany?
His smile became a lesser one. She hasnt divorced me yet, so could be better.
She laughed. Why dont you just leave her, instead of talking about your crappy marriage year after year.
Maybe our marriage isnt quite as bad as I make it out to be. It is pretty lousy, but it could be worse.
You just want her gone so you can propose to me, dont you? She winked at him.
Thats exactly right. His smile warmed her. So what can I get for you today?
In a low tone she said, You dont know how wonderful it is to not be asked the usual questions. I love how you treat me the same now as you did before.
Oh? What happened? A brief moment later he chuckled. I kid, I kid. I figure you get inundated with those damned questions enough; you dont need it from me, too.
Thats why I love you, Clyde.
His brow raised. You just earned a free slab of bacon with your order, my sweets.
Im afraid Im going to need a bigger favor than that. She winced.
Is that right? What can I do you for? What can I do you for was what he always asked. Today she would reply differently to that ambiguous question.
Oh about eighty bucks.
Beg pardon?
She laughed, waved dismissively. Never mind.
Oh! He laughed. I can do you for eighty bucks! He laughed harder. Thats good stuff, Norrah.
I try. But really, I do need a favor. I get paid tomorrow so She hoped hed connect the dots, saving her the embarrassment of having to ask directly.
And
I get paid tomorrow so She gave him another chance.
So you have no money now?
She nodded.
Ah. What is it youre looking for?
Im having company tonight. I promised them rib-eye steaks. I have potatoes and vegetables already, but I have no steaks.
We arent in the business of lending food here. Its not my policy. But I think we can make an exception this once.
Its okay, she said on second thought, just forget that I asked. I dont want you to get in trouble.
No-no, I wont forget that you asked. Id be happy to do you a favor. God knows you could use a positive experience right now during these trying times. Whats a couple steaks? Nothing for a store like this. And I know youre good for the money.
Of course I am.
How many steaks?
I could get by with two. One for each of the guys, and Ill make myself a frozen chicken breast.
You like rib-eyes, dont you?
Yeah.
But you prefer chicken?
No.
Then three rib-eyes it is.
Youre the best, Clyde. Im not just saying that, either. Ive never met such a thoughtful employee at any grocery store, including the one I work at.
Yeah, thats right, he remembered, you work at Staters. Why do you buy your meat here? Before she could answer he took a guess. Because Staters has Staters steaks, not our U.S.D.A. prime cuts.
Exactly. People who can appreciate the difference in steak quality buy here.
He smiled as he moved the rib-eyes around, picked three beauties out, the best looking three he had. He placed them on a clear plastic sheet.
Want me to marinate them? We have lemon-herb, teriyaki, barbecue.
Ooo, teriyaki sounds great.
Coming right up. He put the steaks in a big baggie and pumped the dispenser of teriyaki, slowly filling up the baggie with dark brown liquid. He wrapped the baggie in white paper and weighed it. Thirty-two dollars its going to be, dear. Im afraid theres no way I can ring it up in a way that payment taken tomorrow will satisfy it. The only way is for me to pay and you pay me back later.
I cant take your money. No way. Just forget it, she said shamefaced, I dont need them. Ill be fine. Thanks anyway. She turned and took her first step away, cheeks burning red.
If you keep walking, Im going to shout Norrah Petersen is here, Norrah Petersen is here. Do you want that?
She turned around and gawped at him.
Ill be offended if you dont let me do you this favor. Offended, Norrah. Take the steaks. This isnt up for debate.
She returned to the counter to accept the proffered parcel, her bright eyes conveying her gratitude. He held up a hand (think nothing of it) and said he looked forward to seeing her tomorrow, or whenever she had the money.
She blew him a kiss and strode off. Shed make it a point to stop by tomorrow and pay him back, thank him again. Two teenaged boys stood side by side between Norrah and the markets exit, fixed on her. Their expressions said it all.
Dude, I told you its her, said one.
Why wont you give an interview, lady? Said the other. My dad says
Hey! Clyde shouted at them.
The two boys looked around Norrah to the butcher. With eyes to the floor before her, in full stride, she flanked the two boys.
Come here a minute! Clyde said and beckoned them with a finger. 
The double sliding-glass doors opened for her. She heard Clyde scolding the kids from a good distance behind her now. She got in her car.
Clyde, you wonderful man, she muttered, patted the meat-parcel on the passenger seat.

Chapter Eleven

The dinner get-together was at seven. That was the earliest it could be, since I worked till six, and needed to get showered and dressed. I called Norrah on my drive home to see if there was anything I could bring over. She said yes, some desert. And some wine or champagne. Id hit Staters on the way over. She sounded chipper so I asked what was new. There were no news vans on the street. They had left. Her street looked as it should once again, void of motorists and parked vehicles. I was happy for Norrah. I knew that meant a lot to her.
Aaron texted her at six-thirty to check if everything was still on, and could he bring anything? She said it was still on and he needs not bring anything but his self. She texted directions to her house. He replied: I was there for seven days, remember? LOL.
She LOLd back and added Thats right.
As Norrah peeled potatoes she stared vacantly out the kitchen window at the darkening sky, wondered what its like to cease existing for seven days. For any amount of time. Was it like the phenomenon that is going to sleep and seemingly the same second waking up many hours later? Sleep is kind of creepy like that. Huge chunks of time blink away at once. Or maybe ceasing to exist for those seven days was like how it was before you were born. Just black timeless nothingness, a concept impossible to wrap your mind around. If anyone should know the answer to that question it would be Aaron. Or Brittney, lets not forget her. She was another reason to be in a good mood. Norrah didnt have many friends, and Brittney was a fun girl. If Norrah had to guess, before this whole crazy shit-storm happened, shed have guessed that after a week of being vanished, theyd return starving and dehydrated, smelling like B.O., hair disheveled. That wasnt the case. She wondered if they slept all right that night, or if being gone for a week was akin to getting the longest most restful night of sleep of your life.
She quartered the taters and dropped them in a pot of water, took the parcel out of the fridge and placed it on the kitchen island, tore away the paper and examined the plump baggie with three gorgeous pieces of meat.
Norrah strolled to the back deck, stepped outside. It wasnt as cold as it had been lately. She turned the knob on the propane tank of the barbecue. There was no hollow hissing sound as there should have been. She opened the lid of the cue anyway, turned the burners on and pressed the clicker. She wasnt surprised that there were no flames. Not hearing the propane seeping through the lines was indicative of an empty tank. There was always the oven. She could broil them. But thats sacrilege for steaks this nice.
Ah She had an idea. Paul Klein was still living with God-knows-whom down the mountain, and probably hadnt come up to take his barbecue. That reminded her: she needed to call him to learn what the deal was. He had paid for February, but the month was almost at an end. She doubted hed be paying for March. He seemed intent on living elsewhere. She figured her home was tainted to him now. Norrah wouldnt allow it to become tainted to her. She loved the house, planned on living here for the rest of her life. If she and I were to get married, shed insist that I move in with her, not vice-versa. It would suck badly not having Pauls four-hundred a month, all the more reason to give that interview. Lets face it, there were too many reasons to do the interview and not enough to keep avoiding it. Aaron and Brittney didnt know it yet, but they were going to benefit greatly from the interview, as Norrah has a giant heart. In her mind she already set aside that money for them, so to not interview was to deprive them of what was theirs.
Shed need to tell Paul to get his shit out of her house, unless he wants to continue paying rent. And if he did want to live there, that was fine by her. She harbored no animosity toward him. Sure she was peeved last week when he up and bailed when the going got tough, but she couldnt hold being a chicken-shit against him. People are inherently chicken-shits, save for the few brave souls who employ themselves as fire fighters, cops (ahem; wink), soldiers and the like. If Paul didnt come get his shit by March first, and didnt pay another months rent, she was going to keep his belongings. Throw most of it out, but keep the stuff she wanted. Shed make a guest bed out of his king-sized bed. It was comfortable, she had laid on it once when Paul wasnt home (yes my girlfriend can be creepy-weird at times). He had nice furniture, a nice big LCD television. And his barbecue. Hers was nicer, but it lacked a current essential element at the moment: propane. She opened the hatch and went down a few steps before reconsidering. Should she bring the steaks down and a fork? Eh, not yet. It wasnt freezing outside, but it was in the forties, she judged, so it would take a while for the grill to get hot. Shed let it warm up a trifle. Down the stairs she went.
Early in the morning, risin to the street light me up that cigarette and Ill strap shoes on my feet, she sang as she went. Sublime was happy music. Would there be desert after the desert? She wondered. The after-pie desert known as wicked hot sex? She smiled. Loooove is its what I got I said remember that.
The back door was unlocked. She hit the outside lights, which might not have been necessary, but it had become dusk. Pink and orange sunlight was both strange and beautiful. She stepped out. At the end of the patio the barbecue stood. It was against the railing and facing the last of a series of large basement windows. It took her a minute to learn the barbecues functionality, eventually got it started. On a hook was the scraper. The grill was a little crusted, black tar-looking crud stuck to it. She got to scraping it, cringing at the strident sound it made. She checked her watch: 6:43. The food wouldnt be ready to eat till about half past seven, but that was okay. She never claimed that dinner would be ready at seven.
Love is its what I got I said remember that. Her hip vibrated, cell phone played Nat King Coles Unforgettable. She saw it was me calling.
Well hello there, good looking, she said cheerily into the phone.
I said looove is its what I got I said remember that, I sang.
Her jaw dropped.
Life is too short so love the one you got, cause you might get run over or you might get shot I continued to sing. I began laughing.
How did you know I was singing that, she said bewildered.
Because you butt-dialed me. I enjoy your singing voice, dumpling.
Oh. You brat. You freaked me out.
Sorry. I just left my house. Ill be there in a few.
I was just wondering if there was going to be after-desert desert.
I have a peach pie. And two bottles of champagne.
Sounds good. But thats not what I meant.
After-desert desert? Hmm. So peach pie, then hair pie?
She burst out laughing. Youre gross! No, no hair pie for you, sicko.
It is a little outdated, that term. Since the wild unkempt look has been out for about a decade or two now. I like them shaved, more aerodynamic. As a benefit you can run and swim faster, too. And I suppose make love faster: less wind resistance. I once dated a girl with a bush so big that she kept her car keys in there.
Stop being gross and get your buns over here. Hurry up.
Will do. Bye.
She pocketed the phone. Hair pie she said thickly and rolled her eyes. 
She scraped the grill a little more before calling it good. She looked center-deck to the three-foot gap section in the railing, which was an entrance to the acres of forest that was her backyard. Well, not hers, someone else presumably owned it. The snow there had melted partially, the tracks Fred the fat ass and I had made had melted away. It was a peculiar thing, the single set of tracks that stopped abruptly fifteen or twenty feet from the house. Fred had opined that someone had back-tracked perfectly. But for what reason? None of that really mattered anymore, she supposed.
She closed the lid on the barby and turned around, took a single step and stopped. She saw something obliquely through that far window at the end. Without looking directly at it, her memory showed her what it was: a person being hanged by that damned blinds cord. She bravely looked directly at it: the body wasnt there. It was mostly dark inside. She made blinders with cupped hands to cut the twilight glare from the window, and pressed her face against it. On the hearth was a dark mass that she knew to be a broad-rimmed hat. Two little spots of white were the horns. She scanned the room.
Life is too short so love the one you got, cause you might get run over or you might get shot. Her heart wasnt in singing this time. She left the window smelling the charred remains of some old cattle-flesh being seared away on the grill, and opened the door.
I said remember that loooove is
She flipped the inside-light switch on and wished she hadnt. She gasped sharply. It was like a hologram baseball card that you can rotate to see the batter going through the movements of his swing. Bodies were pulsing into view and fading out just as the next body pulsed into view, all around the room, body after body, no two bodies present at once. She felt dizzy, put a hand on her forehead and swooned. No-arms Pirate, Phantom dissected like a science project, torn in half Mouse, face torn off Catwoman, back ripped open Frog, and there was the man choked to death by the blinds cord wearing a batman mask, his throat swollen and purple, tongue lolling out of his mouth.
Norrah made a fucked up kind of cry-moan and dashed to the stairs, took one step and tripped, dropping to her knees on the sharp edge of a step. She looked between the posts of the banister: bodies blinked in and out of view, round and round like a carousel. As she pressed herself up to a stand, she saw one particular body that seized her attention. A girl in a deep red dress on the floor beside the bed, headless. It disappeared, appeared, disappeared, appeared and continued to cycle, along with the others. She sprinted up the stairs and slammed the hatch closed behind her.
She strode to the bathroom off the den and cranked the faucet on, splashed water at her face, looked up at her reflection in the mirror.
Whats wrong with me, she muttered, splashed more water at her face. She needed to hear the comforting voice of someone she knew, withdrew her cell from pocket and called me.
Yessum? I answered. Call to hear more of my reasons why shaved coochies are more practical than hairy ones? Underwear fit better, I began, no gray hairs in private places, giving vaginas a more youthful appearance.
How close are you?
About a mile or so. Why? Need me to pick up something else? I bought a pie at Staters.
No. 
Silence. I heard nothing but her heavy breathing.
Hun? I said. Something wrong?
no. Its just nothing. She knew I wasnt going to let it slide so she came out with it before I had to chance to needle it out of her. You know how I said I saw them? The bodies?
Yes.
I just saw them again.
I hummed. I think whats happening is all the stress youve suffered as of late is wreaking havoc on your senses. I thought about that the other day, but didnt mention it. All the attention youve been getting, it takes a toll, you know?
You think?
I do. Hallucinations. I doubt its anything serious, but if youd like you can make an appointment to see a doctor and Ill come with.
God, Jay, Im so lucky to have you. I mean it. That makes perfect sense. And that you care enough about me to offer to take me Im just so grateful to have you.
Youre a peach to say.
In the ensuing brief stretch of silence, Norrah became cognizant of water dripping periodically in the nearby kitchen.
See you in a minute, she said and hung up.
Drip. Drip.
Damnit, she said when she saw what was making the noise. On the kitchen island was her plump bag of steaks and teriyaki marinade. The bulging corner of the bag was leaking. It puddled on the island granite before running over the side and dripping onto the wooden floor. She had a mop and bucket on wheels in the den utility closet. She could have it cleaned up before I got there. She was glad she hadnt emptied the water (dirty as it was) the last time she mopped. She didnt feel like dealing with filling it up right now.
Drip. Drip.
I should have thought of that, stress-induced hallucinations, she thought. It has been one hell of a week or two. Nerves on edge. She maneuvered the bucket by the mop handle into the kitchen. Im lucky thats all its been, a few pesky hallucinations. I need a vacation, thats what I need. To get out of town for a few days. Maybe Jay could come with me, how fun would that be? Maybe Yosemite, or Disneyworld. Maybe a pre-condition of my interview could be a pair of round-trip tickets to Orlando. Would that seem greedy to ask for?
It was getting darker outside, a lavender sky and a chilly wind that whistled through the eaves. The single lighted lamp in the living room wasnt cutting it for kitchen light anymore. She flipped a pair of kitchen lights, set up beside the puddle and took the mop out of the mostly-full bucket, wrung it dry in the squeeze thing. She evaluated the puddle, which was pretty damned big, considering its source. A couple feet wide and growing slowly before her eyes. She checked the baggie, which was still plump. The liquid lost should make it flat, but it wasnt. She scratched her jaw, frowning at the goo on the counter top, the red syrupy stuff running down the side of the island, the ever-growing puddle on the floor.
A horrible idea occurred to Norrah. Isnt teriyaki brown? Its soy sauce and something sugary, isnt it? She plopped the mop down on the puddle, and swiped a finger across the counter top. It was red. Her heart raced. Was she hallucinating this? I would tell her yes, and she would waffle before agreeing that I was right. The baggie, though, it was still plumper than ever. She lifted it off the counter: a few drips dropped in rapid succession before stopping. She rested the mop handle against the island to use both hands to squeeze the baggie, applied ample enough pressure that a hole in it would gush teriyaki out. Nothing came out.
Weird.
She placed the meat back on the counter, grabbed the mop with both hands. Her breath caught at the puddle on the floor. It was now four feet wide, a good quarter-inch thick, and crimson red. As if she had to contend with the growing puddle before it got out of control, she swirled the mop head around the sauce swiftly, flipped it over and repeated. Her fingertip was wet and red. Curiosity was getting the better of her.
Please taste like teriyaki.
She paused cleaning the floor to lap her fingertip with the very tip of her tongue: a bit salty and not sweet or tangy whatsoever. It didnt surprise her, she somehow expected it, but it still scared the living shit out of her.
Its not blood. Im hallucinating it, thats all. Can you hallucinate taste? She sure hoped so. The mop head was deep red like Brittneys dress had been, soaked completely, but she kept at it, swirled and twirled, flipped and repeated. The puddle was thinner but still spreading. Frantically she mopped, cutting off the perimeter in every direction. It got to be that the mop wasnt removing liquid but adding to it. It needed to be rinsed and wrung. She lifted the dripping-wet mop off the floor, and when she looked into the bucket, things went from bad to worse. The water wasnt water but blood, and there appeared to be a mop head already inside, its many strings of red yarn floating.
Norrah shrieked, a harrowing blood-curdling scream. She dropped the mop, covered her face with both hands. She peeked through her fingers down at the bucket, screamed somehow louder, as the tangle of mop-yarn that was human hair slowly rolled over. Surfacing was a head, the bloody lifeless eyes of Brittney.
I had just closed my car door when she shrieked. I dashed to the house and flung the door open. Norrah was standing beside the mop bucket, staring down into it, screaming bloody murder.
Norrah, I said and rushed to her, took her by the shoulders. She didnt resist being taken in my arms. She sobbed, wept. Her eyes wetted my shirt. Did you see them again?
I rested my cheek on the crown of her head, breathed her fragrant hair. She shook her head, which shook mine with it. Do you want to talk about it?
She hesitated before nodding once. She backed out of my arms, squinted as she looked down inside the bucket, then the kitchen floor, and lastly the island counter.
What are you looking for?
Its gone, she said.
Whats gone?
The blood.
Blood up here? Is that why the mop is out?
She nodded, wiped her eyes, one final sob.
That settles it, I said resolutely. Were going to the doctors. Tomorrow. Im taking the day off work to take you.
I have work, too.
Call in sick. Take vacation or something. Quit the damned thing.
She pressed the moisture out of her eyes with her palm. Yes, Im going to quit my job tomorrow.
Good. Excellent.
Im going to sell my interview for three-hundred thousand. Tomorrow.
Again, excellent. You deserve it, Norrah.
Im giving Aaron ten percent of it for his church.
If thats what your heart is telling you, do it.
And Id like to help Brittney in some way. I havent decided how yet.
How does such a big heart fit in so little a package? I hugged her, firmer this time.
I just decided I dont want Paul here ever again. I cant express why, I just dont want him here.
You got it. Shouldnt be an issue, he doesnt seem eager to return.
We stood embraced for a moment before she said, Tell me Im not crazy, Jay. Tell me Im not crazy and mean it.
I do mean it. Youre not crazy. Just stressed. Maybe some Xanax would do you good. Tomorrow well bring it up to your doctor. You need sedation, something to calm your nerves.
You make me feel better, always, she said, voice muffled against my chest. What would I do without you in my life right now? She backed away from my chest and met eyes with me. I love you, Jay.
Dont say that. Dont say it because you dont mean it. Someday you will, and someday I will, but youre saying that because youre emotional right now. Its not fair to either one of us.
Youre right, she said in her tiniest voice. Im sorry. Her face was flushed.
Dont be.
I shouldnt have said it. She took the baggie of steaks and got a fork out of the drawer.
Im flattered. Lets not make this a total loss. You went from the bottom relationship step all the way to the top rung in one giant bound. Lets take another step, a smaller one, together. Lets define what we have. Sound good?
She nodded, intrigued.
Good. Would you be my girlfriend? Enter a committed relationship with me?
Id be happy to.
Being so willing and happy to commit to me, her smile genuine and adoring, it touched me. Ill bring a toothbrush over next time, I said, put it next to yours in the bathroom. Her smile widened, parting her lips. We can exchange house keys and all that. Sound good?
Are you just doing this to make me feel better? So Ill feel less embarrassed about what I said?
The hell I am. Im glad you said it, because now weve made some progress in our relationship. Norrah Petersen is Jay Daviss girlfriend. Hey buddy, have you seen my girlfriend Norrah around? The one with exquisite tits and perky ass? Yeah, your girlfriend is right over there. Hey whos that guy holding hands with Norrah? Thats her boyfriend Jay.
Youre weird, she said and giggled.
I kissed her lips, ran a hand down her hip.
Hey, guys, Aaron said from the open doorway.
Aaron, my man, I said and turned to face him.
I see love is in the air.
It is, it is, I said, and shook his hand.
Norrah didnt speak of the severed head in the bucket that evening. She remained upbeat from the moment we defined our relationship. If she saw bodies blinking in and out of sight when we made our way out back to the barbecue, she said nothing of it. I suspect she didnt see them because she was too pleasant for someone who was witnessing images of gory murders. I had my Norrah back, and when shes herself shes the liveliest creature youll ever meet. Its infectious, a personality like hers. Lots of laughter and smiles, jokes and witticisms and banter. Its hard not to have a good time when shes on her game. From the moment Aaron arrived, thats the Norrah who was hosting us. I dont recall when it was, but sometime during the visit Aaron said Norrah is a sheer delight. Sounds kind of fuddy-duddy, sheer delight, but he hit the nail on the head there. Whos that wonderful girl over there? Who, her? Shes my girlfriend. No kidding? Lucky dog, your girlfriend is a sheer delight.

Chapter Twelve

The steaks were nothing short of divine. Im the grill master between us, but Norrah pulled it off splendidly. Our starving pastor was wolfing his down like what was it I said last time, like it was his salvation? Yeah, like that. It was a cozy atmospherecandles on the table, lights set low, Rachmaninoff playing the piano softly from invisible speakers, bubbly being sipped liberally by us (Pepsi by him), a fire crackling not too far away. Aaron didnt say much during supper. He was too busy inhaling his food. We spoke of our history, summarized life living on the mountain in a community small enough that everyone knows everyone.
When he was winding down, slowing his pace as he became full, he spoke of his church, of how they had been considering expanding it when they accrued enough tithings to do so; the seating was so limited that there were always a dozen or so people standing in the back. Norrah fixed on me when he said this, twitched her brow. I knew what she was thinking, that maybe her monetary donation could go toward the expansion.
Tomorrow, Norrah said to Aaron, any plans?
He swallowed a mouthful of food before saying no.
Come by around eight. Not for dinner but for cake or something. I believe Ill have some exciting news for you.
Oh? Intriguing. He cut through the last of his steak lazily, too full to eat it but too delicious not to.
Norrah took a roll from the basket and stared at it vacantly, her mind elsewhere. She looked over at Aaron. At the party were you Frog?
He lowered the steak-spearing fork from near his mouth. Why yes I was. Howd you know?
I had lunch today with Brittney. She told me everything about the party.
Brittney? Which one was she?
Black Cat.
Oh, he said disappointedly.
Would you estimate that Im a decent judge of character? Do you think I can tell the difference between a good and bad person?
I believe so, yes, he said in earnest. He discarded his fork for a moment, as this was an interesting segue to a question or statement.
Then believe me when I tell you that Brittney is a good girl. Nobodys perfect, as you well know. Not you, not me, not anyone. Im aware of what she did at the party. Yeah it was in bad taste, but she was out of her element, and had a lot to drink. And if you ask me, Jonathan took advantage of the situation. She has a good heart, is more modest than her actions that night would lead you to believe. If you had never heard of Tiger Woods and went to a golf tournament, watched Tiger play a ten-over-par, youd form the opinion that hes a lousy golfer, when all it was was a bad day. Bad days happen. I doubt Brittney would do what she did twice in a hundred times.
Okay, Aaron said indifferently.
When she spoke of what Frog was telling her there on the bed, I suspected that it was you, because of the God references. And if I may be blunt, I was a little pissed off at you when she recited what you said to her.
What did you say to her? I asked Aaron.
Norrah answered before Aaron could. He said Brittney should consider herself blessed that she lived to see that day. Because if she had died, Jonathan would have an eternity to finger her before an audience in hell.
Ouch, I said and winced.
Aaron lowered his gaze and shook his head, wearing his remorse on his sleeve. I apologized to her. I cannot believe I said that to her. It was an abominable thing to say. Not twice in a hundred times, as you just said, Norrah. It was a rash remark from an emotional person. She didnt deserve it.
Im glad you see that, Norrah said and smiled her sweetest at him. She forgives you.
Good. Maybe that kind of stuff is commonplace, I dont know. It just seems a little personal, dont you think? That guy had his hand up her dress like he was mining for gold. At least six or seven people were watching it happen, and its not like the dress was obscuring the act. Her body was in plain view. Am I that out of touch? Is that what occurs at parties? A couple were having sex in the bathroom, loudly.
I dont know, Norrah said. That stuff happens, I guess. Kids will be kids. College is only half about education; its a social thing, a time for experimentation.
I dont blame her as much as I blame him. He was capitalizing on the situation. What kind of guy allows his friends and strangers to observe him penetrating his date? Its despicable.
I agree, I said. Boobs are one thingIm pro-mammarybut hoo-has are another thing entirely.
Like I said, I dont get out much. Im not one for parties.
What brought you to this party? I asked him.
He looked at both of us, a brow raised. So weve arrived here once again, have we?
We chuckled, nodded.
I dont know if what Ill tell you will be believed, Aaron said. I suppose thats why I havent said anything.
A pastor wouldnt lie to us, Norrah said.
I am not without sin. But youre right, I wouldnt lie to you. I still dont think youll accept the things I say.
I could say some things that Im not so sure youd accept either, Norrah said.
Such as?
She checked with me: I nodded my consent. I saw everyone dead.
He sobered, brow arched. Did you, now?
I did. A hallucination, sure, but it was real to me.
What did you see?
Like I said
I mean specifically. Did you see me?
You were Frog?
He nodded.
Yes, I saw you.
Dead?
Dead.
Croaked, I said, trying my hand at humor. It was misplaced, nobody laughed.
How did I die?
You were on the bed, on your stomach, back opened up.
He swallowed. Back opened up?
Like torn open. I could see your spine and ribs.
He nodded gravely, took his napkin and dabbed his forehead and mouth.
Dont take it to heart, I said to Aaron, it was just a hallucination.
You really believe that, huh? He replied.
Yeah, of course. Dont you?
Shes more right than you might think. Right to have figured us dead.
Neither Norrah or I had a response to that. We stared at him dubiously.
You say you saw me with my back ripped open. You know what I think?I think what you saw was real. In fact, I know it was real. It happened.
Come on, I said thickly, you cant mean that. I waited for him to break character and laugh, say, I got you. But there was no humor in him.
I suppose I should start from the beginning, and let you be the judges.

Part 3:
Chapter Thirteen

My name is Aaron Mendelssohn. Not Father Mendelssohn, Im not Catholic. A common mistake some people make. I cant speak for all pastors and priests, but I surmise that most of them had no idea of their calling in their youths. I wouldnt go as far as saying I was a troubled teen, but I got in my fair share of trouble.
Fresno is a boring town. People find trouble out of boredom, as if its their only chance at survival, stirring the pot a bit for amusement. The worst thing I ever did was break the window of a BMW parked in a Macys parking lot to steal a cell phone and sunglasses. Maybe you could say the worst thing I ever did was sucker Marie Elbrick into having sex with me. She was thirteen and I was fourteen. We were hanging out under the bridge at the dry riverbed at the northeast edge of town, about a mile from Fresno State campus. We were neighbors and she was my first crush. I dont think she liked me more than friends, but I had a kind of gift even at that age: the gift of manipulation. I got into that poor things head, made her feel like a dumb kid who wasnt cool enough or adult enough to do the things I was wanting her to do to me. I dont remember precisely how I did it, but shortly after I began my campaign of manipulating her, we were lying naked on the dirt making a fine mess of our morals, if we possessed any to begin with.
When I ran into Marie a few years ago, boy was she shocked to learn that Im a pastor. I dont blame her. She wound up becoming a member of my congregation. Occasionally when Im behind the lectern reading my sermon, Ill make eye contact with her and see flash-images of her lying naked under me at the riverbed. Its something you cant take back, becoming an adult at such a young age. Its a concept so fundamental that you cant undo your actions, but its a fascinating one, and a profound one. In a split second you can decide to commit murder and do it, and for the succeeding billions of split seconds of your life you spend them in consequence, in jail. Capriciously, fourteen-year-old me manipulated Marie into having sex, and the man I grew into has to face that consequence for the rest of my life. Not that its nearly as bad as murder, but you get my drift. Consequences dont have expiration dates, they are forever. Forgive but not forget, and all that.
Some people are under the impression that when God speaks to people, its direct. As in we can hear a voice not our own. Maybe that does happen on great occasion, but it has never happened to me, yet Ill tell you openly that God has spoken to me numerous times. His voice is our subconscious. Not every time, but you somehow know when it is. Maybe thats Gods doing, too. When you ask God for guidance, oftentimes your ensuing thoughts are a product of Him. So even though God didnt tell you (for example) to accept that job offer in Topeka, He arranged it so youd feel it was the right decision to make.
The first time God spoke to me was when I was fifteen. I mentioned breaking the window of the BMW to steal a phone? I did something similar to an old station wagon. The difference was that the door was unlocked. I was walking from my house to my best friend Shanes, had only just left, striding along the sidewalk when I saw the wagon, the door-lock lever sticking up. I stepped to the car and saw a bag in there, a purse. I wondered how anyone could be so stupid, to leave a purse in a car, let alone an unlocked one. Thirteen years later, I sometimes wonder if God hadnt arranged for that to happen, as it put me on the path where I am now. I opened the door, took the purse, and took off. 
I was a block or two away from the crime scene when I was confident of not being pursued. I had a look-see inside the bag. Mostly junk like Chapstick and bifocals, but there was a wallet. I kept the wallet and discarded the bag under a hedge. There were ninety-one dollars in the wallet. I was ecstatic. Thats a ton of money for a fifteen-year-old. I removed the drivers license from a window-slot without much looking at it and stuffed it in my pants pocket. Licenses can be sold. Fake IDs. There were no credit cards in the wallet. I was passing by a street gutter, chucked the wallet inside and continued on.
I heard sirens in the distance. I thought someone called the cops on me. I picked up my pace. When a saw an ambulance turn onto my street, I was relieved. Wasnt the police after all. It sped past me in the direction I was heading. It was a block away now, and slowing down. My stomach writhed at where the ambulance stopped, and though I didnt believe in God back then, I prayed that it wasnt Shanes house it stopped at, but instead his neighbor. I took to a sprint, my heart thudding.
There was no denying it now, it was Shanes. A uniformed man and woman trundled a wheeled stretcher into the house. I ran even faster. They were inside the house when I arrived. I didnt knock, barged right in. Shane was the first person I saw, and he was weeping. As was his father. Shanes mom, Mrs. Simon, was being put on the gurney. She was suffering a heart attack. I thought heart attacks were for old people like grandparents, not parents. She wasnt even forty yet. She was heavy-set, though. And smoked.
I sat in the back seat of Mr. Simons Buick alongside Shane as we trailed the ambulance to Lawrence Matthews Hospital. The two weeping Simons in the car affected me; I began crying with them. I was feeling bad for Mrs. Simon, when ten minutes ago I was ripping off another misses (Mrs. Weiss said the womans drivers license).
We were in the waiting room, Shane seated between his father and me. I felt the wad of money in my pocket and felt like a shit. I withdrew the license from my other pocket and examined the woman whom I stole from. She was forty-seven according to her birthday, and smiled widely at the camera for the picture. She looked not pretty but sweet and affable. She reminded me a little of my own mother. This woman would go to her car maybe today or tomorrow and wonder if this was where she misplaced her purse. Shed waste an hour or so searching for it fruitlessly before beginning the tedious task of replacing everything lostor in her case stolen. Long line at the DMV, a trip to Blockbuster for a new card, Blue Shield for a replacement medical card, et cetera. The house the station wagon parked in front of wasnt a very nice house; she was far from being well off. The twenty-year-old wagon was testament to that. So would she miss that ninety-one dollars from her wallet? Any conclusion otherwise would be fooling myself. Maybe she had withdrawn cash from the ATM that morning to give to her landlord, as she had written her rent check for eighty-dollars short due to some unfortunate expense incurred that month. Or maybe it was for medicine. Maybe for heart medicine so she could avoid suffering the ailment that sent Mrs. Simon here at Lawrence Matthews. Every idea I came up with that her money could be used for made me sicker and sicker. What would I do with the cash, buy some football cards? Coax an older kid to buy me a couple Penthouses and a case of Bud? I wasnt drinking at fifteen, but I might as well have started, being that I was obviously on the path to becoming a real shit, a real loser.
For the first time in my fifteen years I was wallowing in self-loathing. I hated myself. I wanted nothing more than to turn over a new leaf, and wished there was a way I could turn that leaf right this second.
A doctor entered the reception room with a grin, which the Simons and myself received as good news. He said she was doing all right and we could visit her if wed like. Shane and his father followed him into a hall as I stayed behind, elbows on my knees, resting my head that felt heavier than it had ever been in my hands. Rushing into the room through two automatic sliding glass doors was a man pushing a wheel chair with his very pregnant wife. They were frenzied, in a hurry to get the baby out of her. She was groaning and wincing. It wasnt a minute later that they had vanished behind any number of hospital doors, the worlds newest inhabitant moments or hours away from joining the fray.
It made me remember Marie Elbrick. I had done to Marie what the man pushing the wheel-chair full of precious cargo had done to his wife. Different outcome, but that was a result of good luck. What if I had impregnated poor Marie? Thirteen and pregnant, yikes. Her folks were Catholic, so I doubt that baby would have been aborted. Id be a fifteen-year-old father right now. How would I have provided for that child? By breaking into cars and stealing cash? My self-loathing resurfaced at the thought. Was it worth it what I did to Marie? It was fun at the time, sure. A better question would be was it worth it to Marie? She lost her virginity at thirteen, years before shed have a brain that cogitated like an adults. Years away from being able to make that weighty decision of first-time-sex with any degree of certainty that she was making the right choice. Maybe if she had never met me, there would have come a point when she decided shed like to stay a virgin till she got married, or become a nun. Doubtful, but at that moment every idea seemed more than possible, they seemed probable. She might have met a boy and fallen in love with him. And after a few years of nurturing that love theyd finally consummate their relationship by surrendering their bodies to the other, knowing its the right decision, and remember that magical and unequivocal evening for the rest of their lives. I stole that possibility away from Marie. And from myself, for that matter. But at least I deserved to have it stolen away. Marie didnt. There would be no magical first time for her. Her first time was pretty much the result of a dare from a stupid-assed punk kid. Not exactly a Cinderella story, is it?
A nun then entered the hospital reception room. How about that? I had just entertained the idea of Marie becoming a nun only a moment ago, and here enters the hospital a nun. She was old and short, clad in the standard nun garb. She held in both pruned hands a coffee-tin painted white. There was a picture on it of some village in a third world country. A sign over the tin read Philippines Ministry Donations, God Bless. She slowly trudged along, passing by every person in there, smiling at each of us and angling her tin so wed all have to get a good look at the villagers who we might decide not to assist in their desperate time of need. An older man in sweats put a twenty in there. Others put bills in there as well, some only coins. But would you believe that every single person in that reception room donated? Not most of them, all of them. Okay, maybe not the few children present, but they didnt have money and their parents donated. When she passed by me, smiled down amiably at me, I had the sudden urge to take my ninety-one stolen dollars and drop them in the tin. I almost did. I flinched, extended my leg to better remove the cash from my jeans, but then decided against it, looked away from the nun in my shame. The reason I fell short of donating the money was actually a pretty good one: I had resolved to return the money to the station wagon on my way home. It was a sudden idea, and when it manifested I felt great about it. Id only be able to return the license and cash, but those two things might be enough to make a shitty circumstance slightly less shitty for the woman, and that was a start in the right direction.
Im sorry, maam, I said to her, denying her the decency of eye contact.
Be not sorry, young man. May God bless you, she said and moved along away from me.
Id have preferred she call me a little heathen bastard. That she was nice about it made me feel even worse. My self-hatred was at high-tide.
The first time God spoke to me was inside that hospital. It came not as a booming sonorous voice like it does in the movies, but as my own voice. It merely said Give her the money. Thats all it said. You might wonder why I think it was God who said it. Bear with me for a moment.
I didnt give it a second thought. I stood up and groped the ninety-one dollars out of my jeans pocket, took a few steps to erase the meager distance the nun had gained over me, and dropped the cash in the tin. She turned her head toward me, looked up with wide-eyed wonderment, then back to the tin where she saw in the wad of bills at least a couple twenties if not more. Her smile was wide.
Are you sure you want to do this, son? It is a lot of money.
Im sure.
God bless you, my child. You are a wonderful boy! 
I wish I was.
I returned to my chair and gazed around the room. Several people were staring at me. They bore pleased expressions, admiring ones. The older man in sweats who had dropped a twenty in the tin was smiling at me, gave me a thumbs-up gesture.
To these people I was a good kid. Little did they know. But if they could see me as a good kid, wasnt it possible that I could make others see me in the same way? The only way to achieve that was to become a good kid. A tall order. But not an impossible one. I didnt want to commit to becoming a saint of a kid just yet. I had to think it through first. What would I have to change in my life to accommodate my wishes of turning over a new leaf? Id have to give it more thought later. 
Shane had returned from visiting with his mother, took the seat beside mine. He relayed the good news, that she was going to be all right, but shed have to stay here for a while. Shane wanted to stick around and said I didnt have to. Maybe sticking around would be that first step (second step if you count the donation to the nun) toward becoming a good kid. It would show that I care about people other than myself. Truth was, I didnt want to stay there. It was Saturday, the best day of the week, and who would want to waste it sitting in a waiting room? I sure didnt.
Are you sure? I dont mind staying, I said to Shane.
Go ahead. Theres no reason for you to stay. Maybe you should call your parents and have them pick you up. Its kind of far.
Nah, its only like a thirty-minute walk.
It winded up being a forty-minute walk. As I neared my house, the station wagon came into view. I felt guilty all over again. I turned around and tried to remember which gutter I tossed the wallet into. It was a block or two past the car, I recalled. I retraced my steps and soon found the gutter. I dropped down to my knees and looked inside. I couldnt see it from my angle. I laid down flat and scooted to the opening, reached my hand down inside and immediately felt the imitation leather wallet. I brought it out and wiped it off on my jeans. It looked good as new. I put the license back in the window. I then returned to the hedge where I discarded the purse and found it, put the wallet back inside.
When I got near the ladys house I kept a good eye on it, hoping nobody would see me. I opened the wagon door and placed the purse exactly where I had stolen it. I closed the car door and turned around, gasped. The woman in the picture of the license was descending the two porch steps and looking at me with a furrowed brow.
Good afternoon, the lady said.
I scurried off down the sidewalk with my head down.
Youre the Mendelssohn boy, arent you? She said to my back. Yes. Junes son.
I stopped.
What were you doing in my car? Her demeanor wasnt accusatory, but one of curiosity.
Uh nothing. I faced her. I had guilt written all over my face.
It dawned on her that I may have had some dubious reason to be in her car, perhaps theft. She went to her car. I took the opportunity to resume my pace homebound.
Is your mother home? She asked. I think her reason for saying it was to make me aware that shed be having a word with my mother if I didnt cooperate with her. It worked.
Yes, maam.
She waved me over as she opened her car door. My heart hammered, sweat puddled on my brow. I went to her.
Whoops, she said, I left my purse in the car?
I guess so, I said. I imagined being grounded for a month, maybe two.
She reached in and grabbed it, looked at me with one brow a little higher than the other. This isnt why you were in my car, was it?
Yes, maam. I couldnt believe I said it. She couldnt believe I said it. Maybe she suspected it, but I doubt she suspected an honest answer from me just then.
Yes? What did you want with my purse? She opened it and fished around inside.
Id rather not say.
She looked at me quizzically, then returned focus to the purse. She took the wallet out, set the purse on top of the car. She held the wallet up between us, met eyes with me.
Do you know whats in here? She said. I didnt know it was a rhetorical question: I was about to say ninety-one dollars, but she spoke before I could. Its my daughters unborn childs baby-shower gift.
I stared at the wallet.
My daughter Emma is having a baby shower tomorrow. My son has the registered list of items Emma chose from Babies R Us. I picked out a stroller that is fifty-percent off. I went to the bank this morning to get the eighty dollars to pay him for it. Hell be here this afternoon.
I nodded, swallowed, a hard lump in my throat.
Aaron?
Maam?
Is my unborn grandchild going to have a stroller that his grandmother bought for him?
Our eyes were locked. I made no movement, no sound. My heart beat so hard that I could hear it.
Would you steal from an unborn baby?
No, maam.
She lowered the wallet from between our gazes and said, Lets have a gander, shall we?
All at once I spewed, Im so sorry. Im so so sorry. I swear Im trying to be a better kid. Honestly. I gave a nun
She held up a hand gesturing me to stop talking. She unsnapped the fold and opened the wallet. She pried it open and I began weeping, bawling at what I saw. I nearly dropped to my knees and covered my face.
She thumbed through the twenties, looked curiously at me, then closed her wallet, placed it in her purse on the car.
Aaron Mendelssohn she said with some importance. It appears I owe you an apology. I didnt openly accuse you of stealing, but I guess I insinuated it, didnt I?
No, maam. I sobbed.
And I upset you, too, she said regretfully. Would you forgive an old lady? Im truly sorry.
Dont be. I wiped my eyes.
His name is going to be Adam, she said. The baby.
I composed myself a little. Adam?
Yes. Hell be my first grandchild.
Congratulations.
I hope you wont think less of me. Ill understand if you tell your folks that the lady a few houses down is a cynical and suspicious old bat. But Id greatly appreciate it if you didnt. I dont want to create waves in the neighborhood.
I wont say anything.
I cried all over again on the short walk home. My mom asked why I was crying. Already I didnt want to lie. Already I was changing and for the better. What I said wasnt exactly the truth, either. Shanes mom had a heart attack.
She put a hand over her heart. Oh my lord
Dont worry, shes going to be all right.
Shes so young!
I nodded, said I was going to my room. She was rushing to the home phone as I entered my room. I had a book shelf. On it were any number of dumb books. I reached up and removed a big heavy dictionary, blew the dust off the cover. I opened it and searched Miracle:
1. An effect or extraordinary event in the physical world that surpasses all known human or natural powers and is ascribed to a supernatural cause.
2. Such an effect or event manifesting or considered as a work of God.
3. A wonder; marvel.
I closed the dictionary and replaced it on the shelf.
That evening at the supper table I asked my folks if they had a bible, and if so could I borrow it. Both were equally piqued; my sister teased me over it. They did have one and my dad asked why I wanted it.
Just to read. I thought it might be interesting.
Being that most boys my age preferred skin-mags to books, let alone books that shaped character and taught virtue and morality as the bible does, they were quite pleased with me that evening, proud of me. Even though I wouldnt consider my folks to be religious people, they had a relationship with God to some small degree, and like many others they were constantly setting goals of attending church more regularly (but never doing it). Their bible would have more dust on it than my dictionary, and they regretted that, as well. My dad said he hoped Id develop a more personal relationship with God than he and my mother had. To them my newfound interest in the bible and God was the closest thing to a guarantee that Id grow up all right, as good Christian boys tend to do. He gave me the black leather bible with some ceremony, having dusted it off and inscribed the first leaf of the book: For my dear son Aaron. May the Word of God live in you for an eternity. Your father, Don. If I had any questions about what I readit was a King James version, a little difficult to readmy father would happily explain it to me. That wouldnt be an issue, as Id put to use the dictionary frequently.
That night I began at Genesis and two months later I read the last line of Revelation.

Chapter Fourteen

I had begun attending Calvary Chapel sometime between reading books Matthew and Mark. My parents are Christians but they dont go to church, as Ive already stated. I went to church by myself every Sunday morning.
I hadnt been sixteen for long when I met Abbey. She also went to church by herself. That shared commonality brought us together. She was three months older than me. I didnt think she was very pretty when I first met her, but she was kind of cute in a strange kind of way. After I got to know her she was the prettiest girl I knew. Such is the pleasantness of her personality. We always sat beside each other in the front row, off to the side. For some reason we never sought to extend our relationship outside of church. We enjoyed the others company, had lots in common, but somehow it just wouldnt turn into something more. But that was okay, Abbey made me look forward to Sundays more than I would have otherwise. I hope I did the same for her. Boy she had a pretty singing voice, too. Church always began with a few hymns. I purposely didnt sing (I moved my lips, though) just so I could better hear her. I take back what I said about our relationship not extending outside of church. We swapped phone numbers. Wed text each other at first (texting was a brand new thing back then), but before long wed call one another. But we never met in person outside of church.
Sometimes Id read a verse in the bible that resonated in me. Id text it to Abbey. She did the same to me. Once she called me, crying, said her grandpa had finally died from esophagus cancer. I cried with her. I felt like I knew her grandpa, she talked about him so much. I dont have the same cell phone now as I did back then, but if I had that old phone Id be able to recite my favorite text from her, as I had saved it. Heres a close enough version of it: I just wanted to tell you that I love you, Aaron. I love you as if you were my own flesh and blood. I thank God every day that we met. You dont have to tell me you love me too, I feel your love. Thank you for making my every Sunday so wonderful.
Yeah, it was a keeper of a text. Shes so sweet. Shes also responsible for nearly giving me a heart attack. A lot of people will say that, upon being startled, something like Oh my, you nearly gave me a heart attack! But I think I was on the cusp of literally having one. And at seventeen years old! If I had the heart of a thirty or forty year old man, I probably would have died right there in church. It happened on the third day of November, 2002, the most profound day of my young life.
I always go to the early mass, which starts at eight AM. That way I have most of my Sunday intact after church ends. Abbey attended the early mass for the same reason. I was having trouble sleeping the night before, tossing and turning. Not bad dreams, but good dreams, though I couldnt remember them upon waking. Dreams that when you wake up youre disappointed and try to fall back asleep to resume them, but never do. As a result of the dreams I was up at five AM. I made some oatmeal and read my bible at the kitchen table. It was still dark out. Routinely I leave home at 7:40 and walk the ten minutes to churcheven after I got my drivers license I continued to walk to church. At six AM I texted Abbey: You should come to church a little early today. Im up and bored. We can chat a little. What do you say? Ill be there at 7:30.
She didnt text me back right away as she typically does. I showered and dressed in my Sunday best, got a move on. My watch said it was seven. Oh well, I could read my bible a little there. There were less people out this morning than usual, for some reason. I guess it was because I was almost an hour earlier than normal.
There were no cars in the church parking lot. None whatsoever. I was early, yeah, but I figured at least pastor Gates would be there a little early, warming up or something. I arrived at the large wooden double-doors with tall ornate iron handles, expecting them to be locked. To my surprise and delight they werent. I guess nobody would steal from a church. It was pretty sacred, even to bad people. Plus it wasnt like there was a cash register there. I went inside, through the vestibule, and into the main room. There was another room off to the right, where Sunday school happened.
Anyone here? I said. My voice echoed a little, as the floor is wooden, pews are wooden, and there isnt much to absorb sound there.
I walked down the center aisle, past the many rows of dark-stained pews. The stage or platform or scaffold or whatever you want to call it was about two feet elevated, a couple steps at either far end of it. I went up the left-side stairs to the baby-grand piano in the corner. There was a microphone stand and mic angled inside the compartment of it, to receive the pretty piano music that Henry played for us at the beginning and end of every service.
I didnt mention that I had been taking piano lessons for a couple years, but I had been. We have an old piano at home, out of tune and in need of a refurbishment. My sister plays really well. Me, not so well. But I try. Since I first stepped foot in this church I had admired this baby-grand. Jet black and glossy, gold hardware. The feet of it were like lions paws. It was a Baldwin, very expensive. I suppose it was pretty safe here from thieves, being that it weighed as much as a small car. I scanned the empty church before having a seat on the piano bench.
Baldwin, I said and whistled impressively.
I struck a C, listened to the note rip into the silence and linger for seconds before gracefully coming to an end. I hit a few more keys and a few more. I had been playing a Beethoven song over the last few weeks, Moonlight Sonata. A common piece for intermediates to play. It isnt very difficult but its very pretty. It sounded good even on my parents old out-of-tune piece of junk, so you can imagine how beautiful it was on this Baldwin. And the room was large with lots of wood, which really did wonders for the reverberation. I imagined a pipe-organ would sound heavenly in here.
I played Moonlight Sonata from memory. Because it was from memory I had to play a little slower than its intended tempo, but it sounded pretty good I thought, and I imagined Mrs. Cortez my piano teacher would have been impressed just then. I closed my eyes as I played it, imagined myself on a stage before a crowded concert hall. Mrs. Cortez once told me that Franz Liszt who played back in the mid 1800s was like a rock star of his era. Concert halls would sell out for him, and there would be hundreds or even a thousand screaming fans jockeying to get closer to him. She even said that frenzied women would tear at his clothes because he was so good looking and talented that they simply had to have a piece of him. I was no Franz Liszt, in the looks department or talent, but just then I pretended I was him. With my eyes closed I saw an enormous venue with thousands upon thousands of fans attentively receiving my pianoforte sonata. When the last note of the piece finished reverberating off the walls, the theater exploded into applause.
Thats when someone clapped in Calvary Chapel.
I stood from the bench in alarm, looked at the girl who walked down the aisle toward the front of the church. Im sorry, I said.
Dont be, said the girl. 
She was nine or ten (I judged) with long brown unbrushed hair, bright green eyes, skin the color of cream, and a pretty white dress. She rounded the front pews, headed toward me. I stood there in wait. She was close enough that I knew I had never before seen her.
Sit back down, she said with a charming grin and gesture. You play beautifully.
Thanks. My sister is better though. I dont have a knack for it.
Sounds like you do.
Nah. I have to practice twice as long as she does to play the same things.
I sat back down on the bench, scooted it closer to the keyboard.
Are you taking requests? She asked and smiled.
Sure, I said gamely and cracked my knuckles. I wondered if at her young age she could even name a single piano song.
How about something from Franz Liszt. She said.
Franz Liszt? I repeated, more than a little surprised by it. Just one minute ago I was Franz Liszt, if only in my mind.
He was a good Christian, you know.
Was he?
Oh yeah. You bet.
Cool. I dont know any of his songs. His songs are too complex for my skill-set. Im surprised youve even heard of him.
I love classical music. She took the two steps leading up to the landing and said, May I?
I was in the process of removing myself from the bench-seat when she touched my shoulder and said I should stay, so I did. She sat beside me, extended her hand and introduced herself as Magdalena, though most people call her Maggie.
Maggie, Im Aaron.
Pleasure to meet you, she said and put her hands in position on the keyboard. Already I could see she was vastly familiar with the instrument, simply by her posture and sudden immutable focus on the task she was taking up. I admired her before she struck the first note. I wondered how long her parents had been making her take lessons. Probably since before she could read. 
Maggie began playing a piece I was ignorant of, a melancholy thing quite lovely. It wasnt complex or technical, at first. But before long it got very advanced, and she didnt make a single mistake or seem to exert herself in the endeavor. My mouth was open as I watched, in awe of her incredible gift. This kid was some kind of anomaly, a kid-genius.
When at last she finished I clapped feverishly.
Like that one? She asked.
Very much. Who wrote it?
Fredryk Chopin. Nocturne number twenty.
You are gifted, Maggie. I cant believe a kid your age can play like that. You are truly gifted. If I could think of a word better than gifted, Id use it.
Kind of you to say.
Where are your parents? Outside?
She shrugged indifferently.
What time do the pastors show up? I asked. Its just the two of us.
Not sure. Im kind of glad, though. I wanted to talk to you.
Me?
Uh huh. She played a few notes softly.
Have we met?
Not till today.
But you wanted to talk to me?
Yes sir.
I must have looked all kinds of confused. She giggled at me, put an arm around me and patted my shoulder with her other hand. Ever wonder if God has a purpose for each and every one of us?
Yeah.
Well I think He does. I believe He has a great one in you.
Thanks, I said, and felt a little dumb saying it.
What do you want to be when you grow up? She began playing a peppy little tune, but did so soft enough that we could talk over.
I have no idea.
You know what Id like to be if I could?
My phone chimed in my pocket, an incoming text. I said excuse me and checked it. Abbey said good morning, just woke up. I texted back that she was going to be late for church.
Sorry about that, I said. What would you like to be?
Abbey responded almost immediately: Church doesnt start for an hour and forty minutes. We turned the clocks back last night.
Oh crap! I said. I forgot about that. Im almost two hours early, not just one.
Yeah, Maggie said. Spring forward, Fall back.
Yep. I texted Abbey: I forgot! Dang. Im sorry, Maggie. I got side-tracked. What did you want to be?
A chef.
A chef? Really? Why cant you be one when you grow up, then?
She stopped playing, put an elbow on the keyboard (a cacophony of notes came and went) and faced me. I have a horrible sense of taste. But food is so beautiful, so artistic. Some of the dishes master chefs make, theyre like works of art to look at.
I guess so. Hey, can you play Bachs Toccata en Fugue? I know its pipe organ, but I bet it would sound cool in here, even on piano.
Sure. Youll need to scoot down a little more, though; Ill have to reach some keys down there.
I scooted down, prepared myself to be awed. No way could she know such a complicated song. She began playing it. It sounded weird at first, it being piano instead of organ, but it didnt take long for that sensation to pass and it was totally awesome. With my cell still in lap I dialed Abbeys number. Instead of speaking to her, I set the phone upright on the piano and let her hear for herself. Maggies fingers were moving so fast that they were a blur at times. And her expression, it didnt look like she was executing something challenging at all. Just another day at the office, her face said. I had heard that Beethoven, Liszt, and Mozart were playing songs such as these before ten years of age, but its one thing to hear about it and a whole nother thing to witness it. Its a surreal experience.
Wow, I said as she transitioned into my favorite part of the piece. Incredible.
She played the entire piece, eleven minutes of bliss. When the song came to an end I stood and clapped. She stood as well, faced the empty pews and bowed dramatically. I laughed. A little actor she was, flamboyant as all get out.
That was unbelievable, Maggie. You shouldnt want to be a chef, you should want to be a pianist. Heck, you already are. You could make millions.
Youre kind to say.
I havent seen you here before. Do you normally do the early mass?
No. I was just passing by when I heard piano playing, thought Id pop in.
Im glad you did. You made my day. Arent your parents with you?
Id better be going, Maggie said suddenly.
Really? Why? Stay for church, would you? You can sit with Abbey and I. Abbey. I just remembered I was on the phone with her. She had probably hung up by now anyway.
I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I have things to do.
I thought you wanted to talk to me?
I did.
But you didnt really say much. I was confused but my excitement superseded it.
I know, sorry. I thought wed have more time. Until we meet again. She took the two steps of the stage and headed up the aisle before stopping abruptly, hastily changed directions toward the side-exit. 
What do you mean more time? Church doesnt start for a long time.
She seemed to be in a hurry, was nearly running.
To my delight Abbey entered through the vestibule into the church. She wasnt wearing her usual Sunday clothes, but jeans and a sweat shirt.
Abbey! Im glad you came!
Are you all right? She asked, her tone registering worried.
Yeah, why? Hey Maggie, wait! I want you to meet Abbey!
She opened the side door, waved at me and left. Abbey was almost to me. The closer she got, the more I didnt like the way she looked. Something was troubling her. She didnt speak again till she was up on the stage and standing before me.
Should I be worried? She asked me. I am worried.
Why?
Whos Maggie?
My new friend, I said, looking to the side-exit where she had left.
She looked to that same door. Do you see someone over there?
What are you talking about?
Who were you talking to?
Maggie!
Whos Maggie?
My friend. We just went over this! I chuckled. It was so frustrating that it was kind of funny. Sorry about the call, Abbey, I forgot you were on the line. I wanted you to hear Maggie play Toccata En Fugue. She plays better than anyone Ive ever heard, and that includes Mrs. Cortez.
Abbey looked ill. I heard you clapping, thats all. Aaron, I think youre sick. Maybe you should sit down.
Sick? You mean to tell me you didnt hear her play Bach?
She didnt answer, just peered at me with those troubled eyes.
But but she played it. You didnt hear it? I looked to the side-exit. You saw her, though. I was really starting to hate her look. Didnt you? I said in no more than a squeak.
She shook her head no.
I put my hand over my heart, my aching heart. I was dizzy. I moved to the bench seat and sat down facing away from the piano.
I should take you to the hospital, she said. I drove here.
No I dont think thats necessary. I couldnt be sure, though. My heart was hurting it beat so furiously. I reflected back to everything that was said between Maggie and I, starting with her asking me if I knew any Franz Liszt, and how I was pretending to be just him only seconds prior, and how that was an awfully big coincidence. I wondered if Maggie was a ghost. I hoped so. I hoped she was a ghost and not a delusion from my ill mind.
Abbey sat beside me on the bench, touched my hand.
Maybe it was a ghost, I said.
No, she asserted.
How do you know?
First of all, I would have seen it. But more than that, there are no such things as ghosts. Except for the Holy Ghost.
How do you know there arent ghosts?
It doesnt say there are ghosts in the bible.
It doesnt say a lot of things in the bible that are so. Doesnt mention snow but Im pretty sure snow exists.
Are you feeling better? Does your heart bother you?
Im better, yes. Thanks. Thanks for coming over, by the way. Youre a good friend.
I was confused. You called but didnt say anything. Then I heard you say Wow and Thats amazing, and clapped and whistled. I knew you were at church, so there were dots I couldnt connect.
This is nuts. Im telling you, Abbey, I saw her. Shes real. We had a conversation.
What did she say?
I dont know, a lot of stuff. I reflected again. Interesting though, she was heading toward the main entrance, turned and went out the side when you got here. I dont think she wanted to confront you. Or, I speculated, didnt want me to observe you not seeing her.
She isnt real.
And she said she wished we had more time. I think you coming here is why she ran out of time with me.
Dont talk about her as if shes real.
She said until we meet again.
Abbey asked if I was on any medication or if I ate anything different or have any allergies. I decided to stop talking about Maggie to her. I knew she was real, thats all that mattered. And I liked her, she was a cool kid. I hoped she meant it when she said till we meet again.

Chapter Fifteen

I was twenty-one years old, a senior at Fresno State. I was also a Sunday school teacher. I had been contemplating quitting that gig to become a pastor. They were building a new Calvary Chapel on the other side of town, and there wasnt a pastor for it yet. I had been salivating at the thought of taking that position, and eventually would.
I had finally gotten up enough courage to ask out on a date Rebecca, a girl who sits in front of me in one of my Gen-Ed classes, Art History. We had gotten together to study one evening, and it was at the end of that study session that I invited her to the Fresno State Fair that Friday night. She said yes! She was a tad on the chubby side, but her face was pure joy. I had to wait three long days for Friday night to arrive, and when it did I was nervous and excited. I picked her up at the address she provided me (her folks house) and drove us to the fair. It was early evening when we got there, midnight when wed leave. I spent probably a hundred and fifty dollars that evening, not on just rides and food, but playing games to win her a stuffed Yosemite Sam that she had to have. What made the evening special wasnt anything Ive mentioned thus far, and it certainly had nothing to do with Rebeccawho went on two more dates with me before we mutually agreed that we were just too different to work out. What made it special was the Fun House.
The fair was closing shortly, at midnight, so the Fun House was to be our final ride if you can term it that. Most people were jamming the lines of the real rides such as the Ferris Wheel and one of the few cheesy roller coasters, so we didnt have to wait at all to get inside.
If it was empty in there I planned on giving Becca my first kiss. I actually planned on giving her the kiss on the Ferris Wheel but she was afraid of heights so that didnt work out. The only people in there other than my date and I were a couple kids. Adorable kids, I should add. A little towheaded girl no older than eight, and her little brother whose hair was so light that it was almost transparent. She lead him by the hand, very cute.
The place wasnt rinky-dink at all. I was impressed. It was dark inside, save for the lights framing each mirror. Seemingly hundreds of mirrors in that first room, all at strange angles. Becca left my side so we could have a little fun trying to find the other. I heard a Ptaaang! and cracked up: she ran into a mirror. At least she didnt break it: she wasnt exactly petite. Soon she was in some distant corner of the large room giggling.
Can you hear me? She said from somewhere.
No, I cant, I kidded.
The little towhead girl laughed from somewhere.
Jessica, come back! The boy cried.
Come find me! The girl baited.
Im scared! 
Fine, twerp. Stay put, Ill get you.
I walked around, seeing angles of myself never before seen. I stopped at a spot where I could see at least two dozen images of myself. There was carnival music playing, the same song looped on a track. Its kind of a creepy song, for some reason. You know the one Im talking about, its in movies and TV shows.
Jessica! The boy shouted.
Jessica, stop scaring your little brother, Becca chided from somewhere. I laughed.
I walked some more, expecting to come face to face with either my date or either one of those precious specimens, but the room proved to be larger than I could have guessed.
I turned around and found myself facing a girl. She scared the crap out of me. My heart felt like it had been shocked by one of those hospital jumper-cables things. It hurt so bad that I touched over it with my hand. It hadnt hurt that bad since since
Maggie, I said.
She smiled at me. She hadnt aged a day. Same dress and long unbrushed hair, it was as if I had only left Calvary Chapel that long-ago morning just five minutes ago.
We meet again, she said, referencing what I had long ruminated over: Until we meet again, as if she somehow knew that I cycled that over and over again.
I looked to the mirrors, at my many reflections, and not one of them showed my old friend, who was my young friend. She only existed in the flesh before me.
Are you really real?
Follow me, she said and began walking through the maze of mirrors with me at her heels.
Did you say something? Becca said loudly from the other side of the room.
Danny whered you go? Jessica whined.
We coursed through the mirrors effortlessly. Maggie wasnt fooled at all by them. I saw a few reflections of the towhead girl. We passed through a door into another room. This was the room of the funny mirrors. Tall and short and skinny and fat. 
Maggie turned to face me. Good to see you again, she said and hugged me, low on my chest.
What are you, a ghost?
Ghosts arent real. 
She faced the mirror closest us. I did the same, my elbow touching her shoulder. Unlike before, her image was reflecting, and I wondered if it was reflecting because she willed it to. Through the mirror she was at least ten feet tall, and I was even greater than that. Funny mirrors.
Then what? I asked. A hallucination?
Are those the only two possibilities?
She side-stepped to the next mirror; I followed her. Now we were morbidly obese. I held up a fat hand and marveled at it. I probably would have humored under another circumstance.
Yeah, I guess, I said.
A ghost or a hallucination she said patiently, thats all you can come up with?
She stepped to the next mirror in succession. I closed the gap. My face was distorted massively, legs short, torso long. It was gross. I looked like a freak. But Maggie, she looked the same this time. This mirror didnt distort her image.
We stepped to the very last mirror before the exit. This time it was Maggie who was severely distorted, face looking like it was imploding, chest all bulging, legs long and skinny. But I was normal.
How can that be? I asked.
Perception, she replied. What do you see when you look at me not in the mirror?
I looked at her little figure beside me. I dont know, an ordinary kid.
And through the mirror?
A creepy-looking kid. You look like a monster.
The corners of her mouth upturned. Yes, like a monster. Work it out, Aaron, Im not a ghost or a hallucination; so what am I?
God? Then it hit me: An angel.
An angel, Maggie repeated contentedly.
No you arent an angel, are you?
Look at us in the mirror, she said. You are Aaron, a simple ordinary-looking man not unlike any other man on earth. Look at me. I may be an ordinary-looking girl on this side of the mirror, but not on that side.
Distortions, I said.
Thats exactly right, she said as if I had stumbled upon some arcane knowledge that she hadnt expected me to grasp. You are beauty, I am beast. You are of the flesh, I am not. She looked over at me; we met eyes. Theres a reason why Im telling you this. I dont intend for this to be a riddle, but more of a lesson. Maybe its a kind of metaphor, but not entirely. These mirrors create distortions of ourselves. There are real distortions of ourselves out there, Aaron. You, and me. Beauty, and beast. Distortions not only in appearance, but in philosophy and virtue. Your negative reflection exists, in a boy. Beauty. My reflection exists in a beast you should hope never to meet. Distortions, perversions.
I dont know what youre getting at.
I need you to pray for guidance.
I do.
But you have not listened to Him. In your heart you want to continue teaching those children, but your mind has been at odds with this idea.
You know about that, huh? I said, dumbfounded that she should know the innermost workings of my private thoughts. I shouldnt have been, because she proved herself to be supernatural, but I was awed just the same.
You have done a great job guiding the children at Sunday school, Maggie said. They look up to you.
Thank you.
It would be a shame to give that up. Both for you and for them.
Im not going to give that up, I said, perhaps not selling it very well.
God knows your heart, Aaron. He hears your heart, not your mouth. Ultimately it is your decision to make. All I ask is that you listen to your heart over your mind, and continue to receive Gods counsel. Dont push Him away.
Why do you care so much? Why does God care so much?
She didnt reply at first. Her eyes so green and pretty peered at my own. Listen to God and perhaps youll someday know.
What kind of angel name is Maggie? Doesnt seem like a name for an angel. No offense.
Magdalena, she said.
Oh thats right.
There you are, Rebecca said from the door between rooms. Ooo, funny mirrors.
I looked at Becca, then Maggie, then Becca. I didnt need to ask her if she could see my friend because I knew she couldnt, just as the mirrors couldnt see her unless she willed them to see her.
My ageless friend disappeared before my eyes.

Chapter Sixteen

It was two days later, Sunday morning, and I had just arrived at Calvary Chapel. I was in the Sunday school room poring over my lecture that I had prepared earlier that week. Maggie was right, even though I had refused to believe that I was toying around with the notion of quitting my duty as Sunday school teacher. I loved the children but had considered my calling to be something higher than teaching kids the Word of God. The pastor of the church was Keith Denny, whom I idolized. He walked the line that he preached. He had a way with words, too. Really connected with the parish. And thus attendance rose following his replacement of pastor Gates a year ago. Naturally I was thrilled when he said I possessed a rare gift, and that is making learning scripture fun for kids. He didnt pay out compliments often, so the ones he did issue were received like an unexpected check in the mail. 
Keith Denny thought Id make a great pastor. He said just that, last year, shortly after replacing pastor Gates, and since then I had desired to be what he was, a pastor for Calvary Chapel. It was my conceit that made me think that I was too good to limit my talent to teaching kids, that I was put on this earth for something more. Something on a wider scale than a dozen or so kids. I would be teaching kids as my day job someday anyway, so I didnt need to do it again on Sundays with a fresh set of kids. I saw my job as something I needed to do (but enjoyed doing nonetheless), as it was a stepping stone to something bigger. It gave me much needed experience. But the time had come to move on. I had long been thinking that, even as my heart had protested it. I had deeply connected with most of these kids, and a more rewarding feeling there is none. God wanted me to teach these kids, but I was considering putting my ambitions above His will. Maggie was right about that. It took her telling me to open my eyes. Or at least to admit to myself that I was headstrong on following my own will above His. What I wanted to do was change Gods will, not my own. I prayed that Hed see it my way, that I had more to offer in leading a flock of adults a dozen times greater in number than was my current flock of twelve or so kids. 
As I stated, I loved these children. And I mean it literally. I hoped that when I eventually got to be a pastor that these children would inevitably be a part of my flock. They wouldnt be kids forever, after all.
Most of them had already been influenced by their parents, so they accepted God easily and never argued my teachings. Some of them were just bored to be there, and I could understand that. Id have been one such kid ten years ago. Only one of the children gave me a hard time. He wasnt bored to be there. He seemed to be put there purely to be a thorn in my side, to challenge me. Maybe God guided him there to test my strength.
I called him Trouble. I thought his parents should have named him that. I called him it affectionately though, or at least I acted like it. Theres Trouble, Id say with a grin when he entered the room. I had given Trouble every chance to fit in with the rest of us, but as they say you cant win every battle, and with Trouble you cant win any battle. I secretly hoped his parents would change churches. Trouble had been a part of my Sunday school class for only a few weeks now, so he was a new student, and a somewhat new teenager at fourteen. Fourteen is a rotten year for kids who were raised by lazy non-caring parents (Im not saying those are among his parents traits, but had I met them I wouldnt be surprised if they were just that). Fourteen is typically the first rebellious year of a kids life. Trouble was a scrubby scrawny little kid who wore the same blue jeans every Sunday, identifiable by a few rips and frays in the pant legs. It was as though the crappy jeans were a part of his Sunday school uniform. His shirts varied, but they were too casual as well. I had no idea who his parents were, didnt care to know, but it was evident they took no pride in their sons appearance, and on the most sacred day of the week at that.
Brooke was my favorite child. I never called her Brooke, I called her Tinkerbelle. She reminded me of Tinkerbelle from Peter Pan. A spritely little blonde kid with ruddy cheeks, capering about in a skip and song, with an underdeveloped body for her eight years of age, as if her mother had been a smoker when she was pregnant (though she was absolutely not!). She was no taller than your average five-year-old. She was thin, pallid, had a thatch of dense unmanageable buttermilk-blonde hair, and possessed enormous blue eyes. They were hard not to stare at. So beautiful they were, a deep cobalt blue. 
What I loved most about Tinkerbelle was her enthusiasm, which was infectious to the other kids, as was her smile with pearly white teeth, a couple of them crooked. Her parents I did know, Sven and Juliann. They were both blonde and blue-eyed as well, Scandinavian immigrantsSweden, I believe. Their Tinkerbelle was their reason for living, and who could blame them? She was the kind of kid who makes you want to have some of your own, and pray that they turn out just like her. And that had nothing to do with how cute she was (okay, maybe a little). It was her politeness, disposition, and positive attitude. But on the other side of the coin was the likelihood that she might make you a young grandparent, and give you ulcers once she reaches the age to date boys. Not to mention the kids on backs of milk cartons are rarely homely; they tend to look like like Tinkerbelle. Ever come across a kid so precious that you wish science had reached a point that we could cryogenically freeze the growth gene to keep them locked in youth? If not, you havent met Tinkerbelle.
My students adored her, with the exception of Troublehardly surprising. 
Today Trouble decided to give her a wedgie, pulled the back of her underwear high up. Poor Tinkerbelle bemoaned the discomfort, but was too agreeable and kind to get angry at him. She asked him to pick on a girl his own size, and did so with a pleasant-enough expression. It angered me. I made Trouble stand in the corner (yes Im aware fourteen is an inappropriate age to send to the corner), and was a little surprised that he obeyed me. Had it been any other kid forced to stand in the corner, the other kids might have teased him a little, lightheartedly. But Troubles peers didnt want to get on his bad side, even though they had found his bad side the moment their paths had crossed.
There were sixteen chairs in the room, four rows wide and deep. I had less pupils than that, but only by a couple. They were listening to me talk about Jonah being swallowed by a whale. Its a fascinating story for youths. They can hardly believe such a thing happened.
Was it a Sperm whale? Trouble asked from the corner, delighted by his cleverness. He had faced away from the corner and took to a seat without me noticing, sitting Indian style. He smirked at me. The children craned their heads around to see him.
Enough, Trouble, I said.
Sperm, he said thickly and laughed.
Whats a sperm? Tinkerbelle directed at me, extending the er of sperm for several seconds. Anything out of that kids mouth was cute, I tell you.
Its a kind of whale, I replied, then glared at Trouble. Youre supposed to be facing the corner till I say you can return to your seat.
Youre not my dad, he said. Go on and tell panty-girl what sperm is, Aaron.
I already did, I said and really glowered at the boy. Enough disrupting my lecture. If you insist on being a nuisance, you can leave us.
Good, he said crossly. Im bored.
Why are you such a jerk, the boy seated beside Tinkerbelle said to Trouble. The boy was Freddy, a soft-spoken introverted eleven-year-old. I couldnt believe of all the kids it was Freddy who finally spoke out against Trouble. And it changed the air of the room at once, created a palpable tension that hinted at ugly confrontation.
I didnt know you were in love with Brooke, Trouble said, provoking Freddy. Brooke, are you in love with Freddy too? Huh, Tinkerbelle?
Dont be mean, Tinkerbelle returned.
I mean it, Trouble, I said in an authoritative tone. I wont stand for this behavior.
Trouble looked up to his left at the empty doorway, a kind of surprised look that I wasnt expecting. It was an image Id revisit frequently in the coming days. There was a gravity to it that escaped me just then, but wouldnt for long.
Trouble then fixed on Freddy, who was now facing me and undoubtedly regretting that he opened his fool mouth. His gaze was low, cheeks red. His assailant regained that loathsome smirk. Hey Freddy, Trouble taunted, kill any hamsters recently?
Freddys eyes blinked wide. He turned to look at the punk kid seated in the corner. You shut your dang mouth!
The kid looked up to that same empty place in front of the doorway. His smirking mouth stretched a smile. He returned his attention to Freddy to say, Youre going to hell for killing that hamster. Satan is going to ram his pitchfork up your butt.
I gasped. I knew I had to take control of the situation and fast. Before I could take action, Freddy bolted from his chair, tipping it back into the boy behind him. I hate you, Paul! I hate you! Youre such a bully! He then b-lined toward Trouble, ranting, Thats what you are, a bully! A bully! I bet your parents wish they had a different kid than you! He stopped short of Trouble, fists clenched, eyes sharp.
Like your precious Brooke? Are you two boyfriend and girlfriend or something? She doesnt even have tits yet, whats your problem? Troubled laughed.
I resolved to march over to the troublemaker and take him by the arm and out of the room, out of the church, but didnt get to him fast enough. I had wasted too much time being locked up with incredulity. 
Freddys buttons had been sufficiently pushed. Reserved or not, introversion be damned, he pounced on Trouble. Shockingly, Trouble didnt attempt to thwart the attack. He was too busy laughing. Freddy put his hands around the delinquents neck and throttled him. I was now rushing to the boys.
You want Trouble said, panting from hysteria, you want Brooke to touch your little weenie, dont you?
Shut your damned mouth! Freddy cried.
Enough! Both of you, enough! I shouted and separated the two, pulled Freddy off the lousy kid.
God hates kids who kill their hamsters, Trouble said with great satisfaction.
I didnt kill Jackson, Freddy argued, he just stopped being alive! Stop saying I killed him!
Says you, Trouble retorted.
Take your seat, I said to Freddy, touching his back. Ill handle this.
Youre just jealous of Freddy, Trouble said to me and giggled. Jealous that Brooke is in love with Freddy and not you.
Enough! I clasped his wrist, yanked him to his feet. Youre no longer allowed in my Sunday school. I began leading him not through the door into the church but to the back exit which opened to the overflow parking lot. I wasnt about to have this kid enter the church to make a scene there. He wasnt resisting me, which was a good thing because nothing on earth would have stopped me from ejecting that kid out of my class just then.
In a few years or so, Trouble said, being pulled behind me, your little Tinkerbelle is going to be Maries age. Remember what you did to Marie under the bridge? What you stole from her? What you stole from her you can never return. How do you feel about that? Did she look at all like Tinkerbelle?
Thunderstruck, I let go of his wrist and froze in place. I couldnt guess as to what my expression was, but Trouble found humor in it. 
Who told you about Marie? I whispered. 
Whenever you see blood, do you remember poor Marie? What you did to her? Love thy neighborsyou sure loved your neighbor Marie, eh? More laughter.
I slapped the kid across the face in a loud thwack. Instead of scaring him, he found humor in that as well. I was more than a little disconcerted. It felt like I was stuck in a nightmare. I prayed to God to give me the strength needed to deal with this situation that was quickly becoming a crisis. 
The kids remained in their chairs (save for Freddy, who stood in the back watching the ugliness transpire). All were silent, mouths agape. Most were too young to piece together what Trouble was referencing between Marie and I, but not all of them. I had a couple teenagers. Kaitlin was one such teenie. Her hand was over her mouth, eyes as round as eyes can be. A teenaged boy was checking the children around him, unnerved and worrying for them as they endured the malicious words of Paul.
I retook the boys wrist and egressed him out the back door, where morning sunlight made me squint. I closed the door behind us, stood before Trouble with my arms folded under my chest, breathing heavily. I wasnt angry but confounded, bewildered. And Trouble, he looked bored just then. Was this boy bipolar or what? What had just happened didnt move him at all. There was no remorse or shame, just arrogance. The situation was under control, under his control.
Why did you say those things? I demanded.
He looked away and shrugged. Then yawned, which might have been a ruse to get me in a dander. I wanted to slap him again.
Maybe you and I should have a talk with your parents, I said threateningly. Who are your parents?
None of your business. And besides, they dont go to church.
That was just as shocking as anything he could have said. They didnt go to church? Why would a boy of such a rebellious constitution go to Sunday school if his parents didnt take him? Or maybe they did take him, and dropped him off to get him out of their hair for an hour or so. That had to be it.
You arent welcome here anymore, Paul. I mean it. Find another church to make miserable.
Doesnt God say to forgive?
Yes, and I would forgive you if you asked for it, but you didnt. And wont.
Yeah thats true, he said and the corners of his mouth upturned.
How did you know about Marie?
He looked haughtily at me. You fucked her, didnt you.
His vulgarity didnt anger me as it should have. I didnt care that he just used the F word. I had bigger things on my mind.
How do you know about her? About Marie. Tell me.
None of your goddam business.
Dont use the Lords name in vain. That vulgarity I couldnt let slide, not in the house of God (or parking lot of His house).
Saying his name in vain couldnt be a bigger sin than suckering a little girl into having sex with you.
I was young, so dont make it out to be something worse than what it was. Yes it was horrible what I did, and yes Im contrite. But you need to tell me who told you this.
He shrugged with a wry grin. A friend.
Nobody knows about that, I said. I dont believe you.
I wonder if Kaitlin would let me do to her what you did to Marie.
What on earth is wrong with you? How could a fourteen-year-old be so angry, so vitriolic? Leave Kaitlin out of this. Shes a good girl, doesnt need to be corrupted by you.
Good girl, yes. Good to take under the bridge. I bet youd like to take Kaitlin under that bridge at the riverbed, he said knowingly. You know which one Im talking about by Fresno State.
I nearly struck the kid once again. It took all my concentration to restrain myself. If you return to my class, I warned, Im going to call the police and have you escorted out.
Are you sure you want to do that?
Absolutely.
Youd call the police? What will the cops learn if you did that? Maybe that you hit a minor? I have witnesses. Try landing a pastor gig with that on your record.
Landing a pastor gig? How on earth did this kid know so much about me! He did have one heck of a point, there was no denying that. I didnt want him telling the cops that I struck him. Assaulting a minor is one of those game changers, the ones you spend your remaining years regretting, living in consequence. 
Just go away and dont come back. Okay? I sounded less authoritative than pleading.
Nah, he drawled. I think Ill stay, actually. Its kind of fun. And I have a feeling Brooke is going to grow up to be one hell of a hot chick. Maybe Ill have some fun with her under the bridge, if you know what I mean. He winked at me.
I lost control, saw red. I grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him violently, some crazed expression on my face. Shut your fucking mouth! It was the first and last time I uttered that word since I was fourteen.
He was laughing, so I shook him harder yet. One shake was so severe that his head snapped back with a cracking sound; his vertebrae re-aligned. That sobered his laughter. He gripped my forearms and ripped them away from his shoulders, glared at me incensed. He pointed threateningly at my face. Dont you ever touch me again, he said in a low tone, eyes alight with rage. Ever. Do it and it wont be the police who takes you away, but a mother fucking coroner. Got it?
I took a solemn step back from him, retraced what I had done. This kid was turning me into a monster. Turning me into what he was. He was brilliant at getting under my skin. In that aspect he outsmarted me. Outwitted me.
Go on and leave, I said firmly. Dont come back. 
No! I already said Im staying so accept it! You got yourself into some serious shit touching me, youd do best to remember that!
I was speechless, had no smart comeback to that.
Heres whats going to happen, he said, sounding much more adult than he was. Were going back inside and pretending this never happened. Consider that a gift. Im staying today and will be back next week, so youre just going to have to deal with it. Try me and youll be getting busted by the cops. Thats the cold hard reality of it all, Aaron.
Just tell me this and well return inside, I said. Who told you about Marie?
Mind your damned business.
He opened the door and went inside. I followed him in. The kids were utterly silent, their eyes jumping between Trouble and me. I was discombobulated, couldnt even recall what my lesson for the day was. Paul took his seat at the back and stared at me apathetically, as if nothing had happened.
I uh I began after an awkward silence. Lets sing a hymn. I cleared my throat, sweat dotting my brow, and began singing: Jesus loves me this I know
The kids werent singing along.
Come on, everybody, I urged, sing along. I tried out a smile; it felt as unnatural as it looked. Jesus loves me this I know One kid joined in, then another. For the bible tells me so. We are weak and he is strong Now everyone sang along, except for the enigma in the back. He grinned his malicious grin at me, eyes cold and calculating.
Before that hymn would end and a new one would begin, I had resolved to tell pastor Denny that I was done teaching Sunday school. Freakin done. I was going to put in for the pastor position at the new Calvary Chapel (just months away from completion) across town. Id tell him after service.

Chapter Seventeen

It was nine oclock in the morning. Sunday school ends at the same time pastor Denny wraps up his sermon, give or take a few minutes. I dismissed the kids. I was relieved that Trouble hadnt caused any more grief since our altercation. He was one of the first to leave the room, in fact. My little Tinkerbelle, Brooke, was one of the last to leave. I held her back for a word in private. Once we were alone I said I was sorry that she had to go through that.
Its okay, Mr. Mendelssohn.
Im so blessed to have such good students, especially you. Youre special, do you know that?
She smiled. Thank you.
Would you do me a big favor?
Sure.
Would you take a seat and wait for me? Id like to have a word with your parents. To tell them what a great daughter they have. Thats not why I wanted to see them.
Okay.
She took the nearest seat. Her short little legs trod air under the chair.
I weaved through the throng of adults and older kids in the main room, heard my name called by a woman. I stopped and looked in the direction of her voice, spotted Abbey smiling at me.
Abbey! I cant believe youre here! I stood on my tiptoes, scanned the area for Mr. and Mrs. Stanwick, who are somewhat easy to spot being that he is well over six-feet-tall and both he and his wife have the same buttermilk-blonde hair as their only child Brooke. Abbey deduced it was a bad time, said she could talk with me another time.
Would you stick around for a while? I asked. I just need to talk to a kids parents for a couple minutes.
Sure. Ill be in the vestibule.
I continued my search and eventually found the couple. I confronted them and requested a minute or two of their time. They were disquieted by the request, worried that their darling Tinkerbelle had gotten into some trouble, which seemed as unfathomable as it actually was. 
When we had some privacy (at the front of the church), I informed them of a bully who was giving Brooke a hard time, gave her a wedgie today. They should be proud of how well she handled the situation. Gingerly I asked them if they thought she was old enough to start attending regular mass with them. It would be in her best interest. I didnt want Trouble corrupting her. They said theyd think about it, that if I thought it was best for her, theyd take that into strong consideration. I then inquired into where they lived, if it was on this side of town. Yes, they lived only a few miles east of here. I said there was a new church being constructed now, also east of here (only more than a few miles), and maybe it wouldnt be much farther a commute than it was to here. With a warm smile I said that I was hopeful to become that churchs pastor, and would absolutely love to have the three Stanwicks as part of my congregation. Mr. Stanwick congratulated me on my soon-to-be position of pastor. I said I hadnt been offered it yet, but if it was Gods will, Id be getting the job. Theyd consider it, especially since their child was being pestered by a bully. Brooke came first in every aspect of their lives, so theyd do what was best for her. I loved hearing it, and openly appreciated their deep devotion for Tinkerbelles best interest. I said that if Im ever fortunate enough to have a wife and kids, that Id feel like the luckiest man on earth to have a daughter half as wonderful as Brooke. They were flattered. Mrs. Stanwick insisted that I call her Juliann, and would be happy to have me over for dinner sometime soon. Mr. Stanwick preferred to be called Sven, and hoped Id take them up on the offer. Their child talked about me a lot, so they wished to get to know me better.
Juliann makes one heck of a standing rib-roast, Sven boasted with a slight Swedish accent.
It is pretty good, Juliann said, her accent even slighter.
Id be happy to. Very kind of you to offer.
We exchanged phone numbers, plugging them into our phones. Friday would be good for them if it suited me: it did. I said Id be right back with their daughter and went to the smaller room adjoining the larger. Brooke wasnt there.
Just then the exit-door opened. Golden morning sunlight enshrouded Tinkerbelle. She stepped inside, the door closed on its own from the pneumatic arm.
There you are, I said to her.
Here I am! She ran to me, hugged me at the waist for no reason. 
How precious are you?
Very! She giggled. Just playing.
Well its true. I let go of her. Lets get out of here. What do you say?
She nodded, followed me.
We were almost to the door when she said, Dont lose hope on Paul.
I stopped and looked down at her. She turned demure, white cheeks now rosy. Dont? Why do you say that? She shrugged, avoided eye contact. You want me to tolerate him? Hes bad for our Sunday school. She agreed with a nod. Then why do you say that?
If She became reflective, and to this day I believe she was retrieving stored information from recent memory. If someone could reach Paul if someone could get through to Paul, its you.
Who told you to say that? It was too mature a thing to say by an eight-year-old.
Nobody, was her reply. She was a great many wonderful things, my little Tinkerbelle, but a great liar wasnt one of them.
I looked to the back door where she had come, then her. Her cheeks glowed a deeper shade of red. She continued avoiding my eyes.
It was an emotionally draining morning, I hadnt the capacity to endure more. That night, as Id roll around sleeplessly in bed, Id regret that I didnt ask Tinkerbelle if a girl with unbrushed brown hair and green eyes had come in from the back door to chit-chat with my little Tinkerbelle, to coach her what to say to me. Once I got the idea in my head, it wouldnt leave. I was probably wrong about it, though. By the following Sunday I had decided not to harass her about it.
Brooke reunited with her folks, who waved goodbye at me as they crossed the vestibule to become ghosts of my imagination for the next six days. I could see Abbey in there, reading postings on the wall. Shed have to wait a little longer. 
Pastor Keith Denny was putting his notes and bible in his black leather bag when I approached him. I debriefed him on the scene Trouble made today. I stopped short of confessing to having slapped him and throttled him. He was concerned, understandably.
I was kind of hoping that I could become the pastor at the new Calvary, I said.
He wasnt smiling when he said, Funny you should say that. I was actually going to talk to you about just that. Originally a man you probably dont know, Tom Dearst, was going to take that position, but has since turned it down for some reason or other. If youre serious, I believe the church would be lucky to you have as their pastor.
Thats great, Keith!
Stick with what youre doing, at least for now. It will probably be two months before the church opens its doors. Plenty of time to think it over. And plenty of time for you to reach Paul. To get through to him.
Interesting choice of words, I said dryly, remembering Brooke. Did you tell her to It would have been impossible for Keith to tell Tinkerbelle that. He was in the next room.
Tell who to say what?
Never mind. Ill do my best, Keith. Ill try.
He shook my hand and returned to his task of organizing and putting things away. I quickly strode to the vestibule, catching Abbey in a great big yawn, which turned into a yawn-smile at my sight. We hugged.
Did you just get here? I asked. Or did you stay for the sermon?
I listened to the sermon. Pastor Denny is great. Not nearly as boring as Gates was.
Totally. What brings you here?
I just wanted to tell you that Im moving.
Again? She had moved to the other side of town two years ago, was a member of some church out there.
Yes, but for good reason. Grad school. I got accepted into Stanford Law!
No way! I hugged her again. Wow, Stanford. How much is that going to cost you? Never mind, it doesnt matter. Its worth it, whatever it costs.
It will take decades to pay off my student loans, Im sure.
Man, Im going to miss you, Abbey. We dont see each other much anymore as it is. It will become even less.
I know, sorry. So hows it going? How have you been?
Fantastic. Oh! Guess who I saw a couple days ago?
Who?
Maggie!
Her brow drew in. Do I know her?
You never met her. Remember? I said hintingly. Maggie?
No. She was trying to remember.
The ghost, I said with a smile.
Oh, her! She made a silly face at me. You stinker. I thought you were being serious.
I am! I saw her again! Abbey, she isnt a ghost. Shes an angel. And Im not kidding.
Lets have lunch together, can we? Tell me about it over some food.

Chapter Eighteen

Tuesdays I had a four oclock Economics class at Fresno State. Class gets out at five, my last class of the day. I had become quite a habitual person, going to Subway on my way home to get a meatball sub. But today was different. It didnt register in me that I was breaking my routine; I was in a kind of mind-numbed haze. I didnt drive home today, I walked. I only live a twenty minute walk from school, but I always drove itwhy wouldnt I? It didnt compute in me that I was walking, when I should have been driving home my truck that was parked in the lot nearest the Econ building. I turned down one street, then another. I had no idea where I was going, and that didnt bother me at all. The sun was low on the horizon, the light bronze.
In the distance was an elementary school. There was a playground being enjoyed by a number of kids, on swings, teeter-totters, monkey bars, jungle gym. I crossed the street to the side that the school was on. It dawned on me that I didnt have my book-bag. Had I forgotten it in Econ class? I paid no attention as I padded down the sidewalk. The small school was right smack in the middle of a residential neighborhood, houses environing it on every side. I was now close enough to make out the features of the kids who were hanging upside-down on the monkey bars. The only one I cared about was the buttermilk-blonde girl, whose pink tee-shirt had fallen down to her armpits. Her little boy-chest many years away from becoming a womans chest. She squealed exuberantly as she swung from her knees, arms dangling down.
I cut over a patch of grass toward the sandy playground area, stopped short of the monkey bars. Brooke saw me and stopped swinging.
Hey there, I said.
Hello, she said with an upside-down smile.
Would you come down for a moment?
Sure, she said after a brief hesitation. Is something wrong?
Kind of, yes, I said without forethought. 
Once she left the bars and gained my side, we began distancing ourselves from the playground. Her pink tee-shirt read Susan B Komen foundation. It was a walk-a-thon shirt, advocating for breast cancer awareness. Cute, that a little kid would wear such a thing. I doubt she had any concept of that horrible disease, but still
I have some bad news, I said sadly. Your mom and dad were in a car accident.
She gasped, stopped walking. Like a spigot cranked open, her eyes poured out. No!
Yes. Im sorry to be the one who has to tell you, Brooke. And Im sorry about what happened in church a few days ago. But this is more important than that. This is about your parents health. Ill take you to them, okay?
She nodded, put her hands over her eyes and bawled, little legs struggling to match the pace of my longer legs.
Wh-what happened to them? She stammered. Are they all right?
I hope so. We have to hurry, though. Hurry before they arent all right. Can you walk a little faster for me?
She began running ahead of me. I told her that running wasnt necessary, that a fast walk would do. We turned at the end of one street, then at the end of the next. 
It never occurred to me that I was dreaming, as it rarely does. But I wasnt dreaming. I was I dont know what it was. But it was happening, somehow, in some way. It was happening. I was leading Tinkerbelle along the residential neighborhood, down past Fresno State campus, onto some back roads. 
My companion was absolutely bawling. Disconsolate. I ceased trying to calm her down. She insisted on holding my hand. It was tiny in my own, so fragile and weightless.
Were almost there, I said.
Where is it? I dont know this area.
Im sure you dont, I muttered.
We were at a road with a posted sign reading Not A Through Street. We continued along hand in hand until it dead-ended, where there was a dirt bank sloping gradually down. The sun was partially obscured by the low ridge of a hill. To my left I could see another road a quarter-mile away, and it was a through street, via bridge. Under the bridge was a dry riverbed, which Brooke and I had just entered. We slanted to our left, toward the bridge.
Here? She asked. Theyre here?
Yes, just up ahead. Almost there.
Why were they over here?
Im not sure.
She clutched tighter my hand in hers, began pulling ahead of me in her rush to be with her mom and dad. I picked up my pace to please her. Her hand was getting slippery in mine; nervous sweat I imagine.
Her gaze was far ahead, and because of it she wasnt watching her footing. She tripped over a rock. Being that she was attached to my hand I prevented her from falling on her face. I suspect if her mind had been in a more pleasant place shed have thanked me instead of being hardly aware that it happened.
The riverbed began to bend to our right. We continued straight, though, to where the crest of the embankment and bridge met. To where I once teased Marie Elbrick that she was just a dumb kid, incapable of doing adult things.
We breasted the embankment of dirt and rocks. Brooke was becoming concerned, and not for her parents this time. This seemed like the last place on earth her mom and dad would have had an accident.
Are you sure theyre here? She asked skeptically.
Yeah-yeah, I said curtly. Less talking, more walking.
I stopped under the bridge, where it was ten degrees cooler and a whole lot darker. The bridge was never used these days. It was built to access an oil lease just a short ways down that road, but those wells had long been dried up and shut-in, deserted.
Tinkerbelle stopped a couple steps ahead of me, looked back with worried eyes, a furrowed brow. She asked why I stopped.
This is the spot, I said and knelt down. Im sure of it. Id bet my life on it.
What are you talking about? This is the spot my mom and dad got hurt? A tear rolled down her cheek. Please tell me where they are, Im scared!
Marie lost her virginity right here.
Whats a virginity?
I scooped up a handful of dirt and let it drizzle through my coned fist. I wonder if her blood is still in the dirt, stained for eternity.
Youre scaring me.
Good.
She swallowed. Good?
I nodded. You should be scared. Theres about to be some fresh blood on this dirt.
Her eyes were wide and confused. Whose blood? Wheres my mom and dad? Please tell me! Tell me, Paul! Tell me, tell me, tell me!
 A loud and long honk behind me snapped me into awareness, into reality. I was in my Toyota Tacoma, at a stop sign leaving Fresno State campus. I was drenched in cold sweat. The stick-shift in my hand was slippery under my clammy palm. I pulled onto the road leading away from school. The annoyed motorist behind me zipped around me, flipping me off as he went.
What on earth I breathed. The sun was ripe, an hour away from setting. I wondered how long I had been idling at that stop sign. Had I fallen asleep? Admittedly I hadnt gotten a good nights sleep since a couple days ago, before Trouble nestled deep inside my brain like a tumor and has since been festering and eating away. Knowing I probably wouldnt see Abbey again didnt help my peace of mind. I was filled with dread that what I had just experienced wasnt a dream but a premonition. I tried to dismiss it, wholeheartedly I did. It was absurd, I was no psychic, had never experienced a premonition. I motored along the road, autonomously made all the correct turns leading to my apartment a few miles from the university. 
My heart ached for Tinkerbelle. What I imagined didnt happen, but that didnt dampen my pain for her any the less. Had the impatient driver behind me not honked, what might I have witnessed in the following minutes? Tinkerbelle getting beaten by fists, fists that were my own? That would be one way to add her blood to the dirt, yes. Hopefully that would be the avenue that her blood came to be on the dirt. But I didnt think it would be. Just as Marie bled on that dirt in a whole nother fashion. 
I shuddered, skin broke out in goose bumps.
Whats happening to me?
I withdrew the cell phone from my pocket in a half-frenzy, tapped icons and words and finally a name: Sven and Juliann Stanwick. I pressed Call.
It rang seemingly a hundred times. I didnt think theyd answer. My breath held as I expected voicemail to answer. And what might that mean? Nothing. But it would mean more than nothing. It would be kindling for morbid speculation, such as the Stanwicks were occupied dealing with a crisis, one that I could make a sporting good guess at.
Aaron, a man answered. What a nice surprise.
I turned onto the street which I lived. Sven. Good afternoon. I was shooting for calm, but wasnt so sure. Or evening. 
Still afternoon for another half-hour. How are you doing, friend?
Eh, Im hanging in there. Driving home from class.
Class? You go to college?
Yeah, Fresno State.
Woot! Go Bulldogs!
Yes, go Bulldogs, I said distractedly. Listen, do you know where Brooke is?
Uh He moved the phone away from his mouth. I heard him ask his wife where Brooke is. Juliann said she was playing across the street at the playground. My heart was at a gallop. Shes playing, Sven said. Why? Whats up?
Oh man I muttered. Oh my
Aaron? Youre worrying me, buddy. Whats wrong?
Uh I dont know how to say this. I didnt want to scare him needlessly. Any parents would freak the hell out with some near-stranger predicting their kids abduction. But I needed them to have the same sense of urgency I was operating under. I uh
Aaron, Sven said sternly, tell me whats wrong! I heard Julianns panicked voice in the background. She was wondering the same thing as her husband.
Im probably wrong about it, I said as a preamble to the bad news.
Tell me! Tell me, Aaron, come on!
His loud pissed-off tone accelerated my panic. I had a kind of premonition, I guess you could say. But Im sure its nothing.
That youre calling me sounding the way you do suggests that you dont feel its nothing. Would you please just tell me already?
Damnit Aaron, whats the matter! Juliann shouted just inches from her husbands phone.
Shes going to fall off the monkey bars and get hurt, break bones, I lied. It was a useful lie, as it would send them to the school playground immediately.
He thinks shes going to fall off the monkey bars and break something, Sven relayed to his wife.
I heard the front door slam shut seconds later.
Shes on her way, Sven said to me. Thank you very much, Aaron, from the bottom of my heart.
Dont thank me. I didnt do anything.
Maybe you did and maybe you didnt. But that you were compelled to warn us, that tells me that you feel her getting hurt is a possibility. Even a remote chance of that happening is alarming to me. To us.
I agree. Thats exactly why I called. I exhaled deeply.
And Im not a premonition kind of guy, but I put stock in a pastor telling me he had a vision of something.
Im not a pastor. Not yet, at least.
You will be. And youre something not far from a pastor. God, I dont know what Id do if my little sweetheart broke her He choked back a sob. Broke her neck or something.
I dont even want to think about it, I said.
I could hear the emotion in his voice when he said, You are a wonderful guy, Aaron. A blessing.
Would you mind if I stayed on the phone for a little while? Id like to know that shes all right. Im sure it was nothing, but I wont be able to rest until I know for sure.
As if Juliann had guessed that was the case, that her husband and I were on the phone until we got word back from Brookes state of hopefully-great health, she returned only a couple minutes after I had heard the front door slam shut.
Oh thank God, Sven said.
I took a deep relieved breath. Yes. Thank God.
Hi, Daddy! I heard Tinkerbelle exclaim. Im not hurt, Im fine!
Yes you are, sweetheart. Were sorry for making you come home.
The little rascal was hanging upside-down on the monkey bars, Juliann said to Sven. I could just picture her falling and getting hurt.
Its okay, I never fall, the kiddo said in her defense. I cant play on them anymore?
Not today, pumpkin. Go get ready for supper.
Yes, Daddy.
Aaron, thanks again for the call, Sven said, and in his tone was utmost gratitude. Probably unfounded gratitude, as it was only a silly vision I had. I guess it was a dream after all.
Im sorry for disturbing you all, I said. I havent been sleeping well lately, so I guess my imagination got a little carried away.
Thats beside the point, Sven said. You care enough for our daughter that youd call us when youre worried for her. You dont know how much that means to me.
Juliann took the phone from her husband and said to me, Really, Aaron, Sven is right. That was awfully thoughtful of you. You really care about her, dont you?
Care about her? I said thickly. I love her, Juliann. I really do.
I couldnt see her tears, but I sensed them. Well she loves you, too.
Ill let you guys go.
Are you still on for dinner Friday night? Juliann asked. We wont take no for an answer, so you might as well say yes.
Ill be there. See you then. Should I bring anything?
Heavens no.
I said bye and ended the call. I had been parked in my designated spot for minutes, my Tacoma idling. I went inside my apartment, crashed on the couch and began weeping. Weeping from the emotion of it all. It didnt matter that it was all inside my head, the experience was just as nerve-wracking, just as intense.
Lord, my savior, I said from the couch, looking up at the ceiling. Thank you for keeping your most precious creation safe. I owe you everything. If I could be selfish for just a moment, please dont put me through that again. That dream or whatever it was. Im not strong enough to endure them. Amen.

Chapter Nineteen

The next day I was at work, a clerk at Truegolds Car Wash and Detail, though I did a heck of a lot more than run the register. I was a gopher, washing rags, pouring soap solution in the vats, even washed and dried cars if thats what was asked of me. I worked Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, from nine in the morning till five. It only paid enough to cover my rent, but that was fine. I was getting grants from the government, student loans, and my parents were great and sending me regular checks of seven-hundred bucks every first of the month. I didnt care for the job most days, but today I loved it. It was busy, as Wednesdays always are, due to half-priced humpday washes. Busy was a good thing that Wednesday, as it got my mind off of the terror that was imagining something pretty damned dark happening to my Tinkerbelle. Large chunks of the day were being eaten away every time I glanced up at the clock. Three hours felt like thirty minutes. 
I was thoroughly exhausted when I clocked out at six minutes past five. I was sticky from perspiration and hesitant to smell my damp armpits.
I had only just pulled out of the parking lot onto Kern Avenue when my phone rang. I steered with my knee as I groped the phone out of my pocket with one hand and rolled up the window with the other.
I read Stanwick on the screen. I hoped Sven wasnt calling to thank me yet again. As relieving as it was that Tinkerbelle had been safe, I was a little humiliated that it was a worry in vain. Him thanking me made me all the more humiliated.
Hi, Sven, I said. I took my Truegold cap off and tossed it to the passenger seat, raked back my oily hair.
Please tell me Brooke is with you, Juliann said desperately.
Oh no, I said inwardly. No, shes not with me.
She sobbed. I pulled into an Arbys parking lot and parked.
Im calling the police, she said between sobs. Shes shes been taken!
I palmed my forehead, closed eyes stinging. Lord in Heaven, I breathed.
I hoped it was you. A sob. Why couldnt it have been you? She ended the call.
Please dont let this be happening, I said.
God works in mysterious ways. Sometimes it can be something as seemingly insignificant as a simple thought surfacing, or a memory. I had one just then, no more than a minute after Juliann had hung up on me. I called her back.
It was Sven who answered, and did so on the first ring. I suspect he reserved hope that I might be able to help them in some inestimable way. He said yes in a wet voice, waited for me to speak.
What is Brooke wearing today? Her shirt, what is it?
Excuse me?
What is she wearing?
I dont know, he said in a panic. I dont remember.
Can you remember what was she wearing yesterday when your wife found her at the playground? Was it a pink shirt? Susan B. Komen?
He inhaled sharply. Thats what shes wearing! Where did you see her!
I didnt, but you should call the police. Now, Sven. Call them.
Juliann is on the phone with them. Damnit, this cant be happening! A friend of Brookes was just over here to say that a man told Brooke to follow him, and they walked away together!
In my premonition, or whatever it was, she was wearing that shirt. I didnt think to mention it yesterday. Give me your address. I want to be with you two.
I heard Juliann wail her anguish in the background; it chilled me. He sputtered out an address that I had to replay in my head to get it all. He was lost to emotion.
In, in, your dream, he stammered, what happened to her?
I heard Juliann tell Sven to come on, they were going to look for their baby.
Listen to me, Sven, I said firmly. Listen to me carefully. Nothing is going to happen to your girl. Understand me? Nothing. Stay put. Dont leave the house, youre in no condition to drive, and you wont find her. I swear to you, you wont find her, so dont bother looking. Ill handle this. Put your faith in me. See you soon.
I threw the truck in drive and floored it, sped out of the Arbys lot like a bank robber with a fresh sack of cash, vehicle fishtailing and tires screaming as I turned onto the avenue. Almost immediately I saw red and blue lights in my rear-view mirror and couldnt friggin believe it. What are the odds? Bastards are never around when you need them, and now this!
Shit, shit, shit!
I pulled over. The sun was directly before me, low on the horizon. Too low. I envisioned Paul walking hand in hand with Tinkerbelle along the riverbed toward the bridge. I looked in my side-view mirror at the cop who was taking his sweet damned time, hadnt even left his cruiser yet.
Come on, asshole!
He was punching my license plate into his computer. Hed waste a couple minutes on that. I didnt have time for this bullshit. I opened my door and got out with my hands up to show him I wasnt armed. He opened his door and said to stay in my vehicle. I continued anyway.
Sir! I exclaimed. Please, you have to let me go! Theres an emergency!
Tentatively he got out of the cruiser. Whats the problem?
A girls been kidnapped!
When?
Just now! I closed the gap between us. Listen, Im a pastor, not trying anything funny here. I have to help find the girl before its too late.
Whats her name?
Brooke. Brooke Stanwick.
Wait here just a moment. He returned inside his cruiser for what felt like ten minutes but was only a minute. He got out of his car at last. I was at the curb pacing around, rubbing the nape of my neck. She was reported abducted just now. It hasnt even been called out yet. Any idea who took her or where she might have gone?
I could have answered both, but instead lied. A bald-faced lie. No idea.
Ill let you go, but you have to drive the speed limit. Got it? No exceptions. Youll kill someone driving like that.
I will. Thank you, sir.
He was still in his black-and-white when I pulled away from the curb at an honest speed. Once he was out of my sight I floored it. I couldnt believe I was remembering how to get to the old bridge over the riverbed. It had been seven years since Id been there, when I was fourteen and a real piece of work. I was making turns as I saw familiar streets. Instead of driving down the street which led to the bridge and crossed over to the old oil lease, I decided to take the path that I had watched myself leading Tinkerbelle across. The dead-end. I had to be cautious, extra careful to not be seen until I was close enough that he couldnt escape. Thats assuming I wasnt already too late. The sun was below the low ridge of a distant hill. It seemed later than it had been in my premonition, and that terrified me. I was easily driving sixty miles an hour down a residential neighborhood. God forbid a kid crosses the street to chase a ball.
I slowed down a good deal before arriving at the end of the road, lest home-owners call the cops or chase after me to ream me for driving like a lunatic in a neighborhood with kids at play.
I got out of my truck and ran down the dirt slope looking to the distant bridge at my left. It was nothing but a silhouette now, red and gold sky around it. It was later than it had been, I was sure of it.
A girl shrieked far away.
You little mother fu
I sprinted down the rough terrain, leaping over underbrush and rocks, praying I wouldnt sprain an ankle. Another shriek. I made it to the bottom of the riverbed and followed the contour of it, the bend that would lead me to the bridge.
She shrieked again, and this time she shouted for help. I clenched my fists. God help that boy when I reached him, for it would truly be a miracle if he escaped with his life.
Stop it! She cried. Youre hurting me!
She was closer. I knew where they were, under the bridge, in the low spot between embankment and the underbelly of the bridge. It was black with shadows. I was risking being spotted but it wouldnt matter at this point. She was being abused, and in my current state Id catch that piece of shit even if he was an Olympic sprinter.
Another shriek, a blood-curdling one; this time it was cut off. I could see in my minds eye Paul bludgeoning her with a blunt object to the head.
I was almost to the bridge. I could see their tangled shadows. I slanted up the gradient. Paul must have heard my footfalls by now. The girl was quiet, indicative of either something really bad or the abandonment of Pauls attack.
Im going to beat the holy hell out of you! I shouted as I breasted the bank at full speed, gasping for breath. 
My right foot snared on something, then my left foot, sending me airborne before crashing down, my head smacking a rock.
I might have been unconscious. If so it wasnt for long. My head ached something wicked. I pressed my upper body off the ground, saw a series of low rocks in a line too neat to be a coincidence. Just then a foot kicked me in the ribs, sending me back down.
You like that? Paul said smugly. Hows that for precision? He kicked me again, this time in the left kidney. So painful it was that it rendered me motionless for some timeless moment, back arched, hand pressing against my abused kidney. He walked around me, stepping over the fishing line that had been secured to two large rocks spaced fifteen or twenty feet apart. There was a third rock at a different angle with fishing line tied to it, as well. He didnt want to leave anything to chance. He had estimated where I might land after trippinghence the rows of smaller rocks designed to bust my head upon.
Brooke? I called, panting, wincing. Are you okay?
From behind me Paul kicked my back. It caught between two ribs, dividing the impact, lessening what it might have otherwise been.
I felt the gravity of the situation in full just then, what it might mean if I didnt put together a counter-attack that second. With a surge of adrenaline, disregarding the torrents of pain, I erected to my hands and knees and was a second away from standing when Pauls foot thrust squarely into my crotch. Adrenaline be damned, I wasnt coming back up from that.
Finished yet? Paul said. I couldnt see his smug smile but I sensed it. You fucked up, dude. You fucked with the wrong guy.
Why are you doing this? I asked as I clutched my groin.
I doubt youd understand. Would you believe Im doing this because it seemed like a fun idea?
Youre evil.
Maybe. But this beats watching The Bachelor, eh? He laughed. Or jacking off.
You better not have done that to her.
Jacked her off? What are you talking about, Mr. Mendelssohn?
You know what I mean. I tried to stand but pain disrupted the attempt.
Youre such a hypocrite, man. He kicked me in the right buttocks. You teach us to be virtuous and praise God, but what skeletons do you keep in your closet? Suckered a thirteen-year-old girl into screwing you in public? Arent you ashamed of yourself, you hypocrite?
I said nothing.
Breaking into cars, stealing phones and money. How do you want to become a pastor? Thats all religious people are: hypocrites. You preach the gospel for tithings, so you can buy shit. Youre the piece of shit, not me.
He stepped on my hand with his heel, crushed it with a turn. I yelped.
I hate you people. I really do. He knelt beside me.
Paul, I breathed, coughed. Just let Brooke go. Thats all I ask. Dont do anything to her.
Whos holding her back? Shes free to go. And just what are you implying, that I would rape a little girl? Thats fucking disgusting. You would automatically think thats what a boy my age would do. A boy our age. You were what, fourteen? Takes one to know one, huh?
Brooke? I called in her direction. I couldnt see any more than a darker shadow assumed to be her. Hun? Tinkerbelle?
Oh, he said and snapped his fingers melodramatically. I may have accidentally hit her over the head with a rock.
Youre going to burn in hell, I said.
Wrong! Im going to come out of this better than you think!
I rolled over to my back slowly and began to sit up. When he wound his foot back to kick me, I held my hand out pleadingly, gesturing that I wasnt going to attempt to escape, but simply sit up. He allowed it. Sitting was a painful event. My insides were on fire around the kidneys and liver, testicles swollen and throbbing. 
How did you know to set up the fishing line? I asked. Howd you know I was coming, and where Id come from? How do you know so much? Desperation was imbedded in every syllable. Tell me, I have to know. 
I could ask you the same question. How did you know I would be here with Brooke?
I saw it. Thats all. I dont know, Paul. Thats the truth.
Yeah, I think you have friends in high places. Thats what I think. Maybe I have my own. Ever think about that?
Who?
He walked around to my backside. I went rigid in anticipation of him kicking me. A tense second later I craned my head back. He feigned kicking me. I moaned and writhed. He laughed. He dug the toe of his shoe in the dirt and flung it at me.
Youre a pussy, he said. You know that? Heres whats going to happen. Im going to let you live. And your sweetheart Brooke. Yeah I hit her on the head, but shell get over it. Heres what youre going to do in return: Sunday you are going to get up there before the entire Calvary Chapel congregation. Tell that douchebag pastor Denny that you have an important message for them, because thats the damned truth. Youre going to tell everyone there what you did when you were fourteen, and in explicit detail. Youre going to tell how you tricked a girl no older than half the kids in Sunday school to screw you under the bridge. Youll also say that you stole money from an old ladys purse. Feel free to add more confessions in there. The truth will set you freeisnt that what that black dude said to Neo in The Matrix? Youre going to do that Sunday, or else.
Youll be in juvenile hall come then, I said. Are you so arrogant that you cant see that? Youre in serious trouble. Unless you have it in you to kill us both, which I dont believe you do, youre going to be imprisoned.
Dont tempt me. Youd be surprised what I have in me. The reason why youre going to do what I just said, and why you wont report me to the police, is because Im letting you both go. This is a get-out-of-death free card. You only have one. If you dont specifically do what I just said, Im going to kill not youno, Im not going to kill you; I want you to live through whats going to happenIm going to create some tragic end to your Tinkerbelle. I would say rape and kill her, but that would be a lie. I wish I had it in me to do that, but I dont. Shes a fucking kid, for chrissake. If she were a little older, yeah, Id do that just to piss you off. But I will kill her, Aaron; that I will do. And youll have to live with yourself knowing that your actions led to that precious thing, he intoned, getting murdered. Could you live with that? I know you have a hard-on for her, and probably have ideas of being her first lay, so I doubt youd want that.
I shook my head. I wanted to puke from both the pain and this lunatics presumptions.
Do we have an understanding? He asked. Do it this Sunday, or else. And if you mention my name to anyone, itll be the same outcome. Death of an angel, a little blonde-haired angel. Once you do as I say, Ill be done with you. I hear Los Angeles is fun, I might go check it out.
It was dark out, so I wasnt sure if he saw me nod. I said we have a deal. But only if he answered one question for me.
I already told you, dude, a friend. Thats all you need to know.
No, not that, I said. Why me? Why are you doing this to me? What did I ever do to you?
Nothing at all, he said sincerely. I do hate you, but thats only a recent hatred. I suppose youre wondering why I went to your Sunday school classes. Because I was asked to.
By your friend, I surmised.
Ill be sitting in the front row this Sunday. I wouldnt miss it for the world. Remember, you have only one chance at this. Do you believe me when I say I have the resources to ensure Brookes death? Because you better damned believe that I do. That fishing line that tripped you up, thats a small example of how much smarter I am than you, and how I know things.
I believe you, I conceded.
Shake on it?
He rounded me, thrust out a hand to shake. I put mine in his. Upon shaking it, he kicked me with a knee to the side of my head. Lights out.

Chapter Twenty

It was full-dark before Tinkerbelle woke up under the bridge with me sitting at her side, calling her name. Paul was long gone. She awoke with a gasp and no idea where she was. I said my name and promised everything was all right. She got up touching at the side of her head with a hiss. I led her hand in hand along the riverbed toward my Tacoma. I wanted to get a good look at her head, at that nasty cut. I felt the blood on her temple. She was crying and asking questions I wouldnt answer, except for one, and thats are my parents all right? Yes, they were fine.
Sweetie, we need to have a talk, I said. Youre too young to understand the seriousness of this situation, but you need to have faith in me. Will you? For me?
She nodded, sobbed.
First of all, youre going to be all right from now on. I promise. Paul wont bother you ever again. You have my word.
Kay.
You and I are in the same boat now. We both know something that we cant tell anyone else. Anyone else. That includes your mom and dad.
I cant lie, she said.
I know, but this time you have to. When I said nothing bad will happen to you, that will only be the case if you lie about tonight. When we get to your parents house, youre going to say a boy from your church walked with you just to say hes sorry about the scene he made the other day. After his apology he left. You decided to I dont know go play somewhere. I guess you can be honest in where you were, the riverbed. It shouldnt much matter. But how you got hurt is you tripped and hit your head on a rock. You must say that, Brooke. You cannot mention that Paul had anything to do with it. Tell me youll say that. Tell me youll lie for me.
She was weeping hysterically now, but she nodded.
Tell me, sweetheart. I need to hear you promise.
I promise.
Stick with the lie. Ill talk to your parents and tell them the story before you get a chance to, so it should be easier on you. Just confirm what I say.
Why cant I tell them the truth? Why dont you want Paul to get in trouble? Pauls a bad kid.
Youre too young to understand. I dont mean that as an insult, its just the simple truth of the matter. Bad things will happen if word gets out. Really bad things.
I want to go home, she said softly, crying.
I drove her home. Inside my truck I had a good look at her head, and worried shed need stitches. Shed get by with some butterfly bandages, I supposed. Mostly I was relieved she wasnt sexually assaulted. As much as I loathed Paul, I was fairly certain that he was honest in his remark that he had no desire to molest a child. Had Paul molested her or worse, Im not sure Id have agreed to keep it a secret, even under the threat of killing Brooke. I couldnt say what Id do, but how on earth could I let that boy touch Brooke in a way that would scar her for life without avenging her? Thank God that wasnt the case.
I myself looked like hell. My forehead was cut from the initial spill I took. At least my shirt concealed the damage Paul inflicted upon me with his foot. Id have some scars come Sunday, when a hundred people would watch and listen to me confess some seriously horrendous things. I didnt want to think about that just yet. I needed to get through tonight.
There were several cops parked at the Stanwick house. I pulled right up and reminded my little friend of the severe consequences that would befall us both if she didnt stick to our lie. She darted out of the truck to reunite with her parents who had watched us pull up and were losing their minds to excitement. I took satisfaction in their joyful expressions, their tender embrace. Her parents were crying harder than Brooke. Juliann had only just noticed her girls injury, ushered her inside to get a closer look.
I told our contrived story to the Stanwicks and the cops. Nobody sensed it was lie, or they might have asked more questions. It helped that I was the girls Sunday school teacher, Im sure. It attached credibility to my story. I was eager to get the heck out of there, and did before long. I winked at Tinkerbelle as I left.

*  *  *

That Friday was the dinner-date at the Stanwicks. I had mixed feelings about going. I didnt want to be asked questions about the other day because I disliked lying to them. I figured theyd see through my lies, as I was poor at it. Fortunately they were just as eager to avoid the topic as was I.
Tinkerbelle didnt look her usual happy self. She didnt have much to say. I guess my presence forced her to remember our secret, that damned lie. As I sat at the table eating the standing rib-roast that really was as good as Sven had promised, I stole glances at the girl. Her big blue eyes were low and avoided mine. Before my plate would be empty Id conclude that things would never be the same between us again. It was a hard pill to swallow, but I wanted to do what was best for her, and resolved to make that happen.
After dinner we had boysenberry pie and coffee. Brooke was dismissed. I heard her watching some Disney movie in the next room. Sven was talking about his job as a foreman at a textiles factory uptown when I noticed a tear rolling down Julianns cheek. I asked if something was the matter. Sven stopped talking and looked over at his wife.
She nodded and said, Im sorry. I know you dont want to talk about it, and trust me, Aaron, neither do we, but I have to tell you how lucky we are to have you in our lives. What you did the other
I held up a hand, cutting her off. It was nothing. And youre right, Id rather not talk about it; would rather not remember it.
She wiped her wet cheek with the back of her hand.
Would you two mind if I had a word alone with Brooke? I asked.
I left my slice of pie half-eaten and ambled to the living room, where 101 Dalmatians was being watched by a kiddo on the couch. She was lying on her side, head propped up in hand. She only glanced at me. There was no excitement from my company, no smile, just a vacuous expression that worried me.
I asked if I could have a seat beside her. She sat up. I took a seat and glanced over my shoulder: the Stanwicks remained at the table, a safe distance from overhearing what I had to say. Sven had his wifes hand in his, consoling her.
Can we talk for a minute? I asked her. I paused the movie.
Kay.
How are things going, sweetheart?
Fine. She finally met eyes with me, and this time they remained on mine.
Youve been great. Thank you. Youre mature for your years. I hesitated before saying, What would you think about getting a new Sunday school teacher?
She shrugged, and that pained my heart. Last week I believe she would have been upset by that question, begged me not to go, and cried from it.
You probably think this is my fault, I said. And maybe it is, I dont know.
I know it isnt, she said thinly.
Thank you for saying that. You have no idea how good it is to hear it. We both know that things are different now. I only want to do whats best for you. Thats all that matters to me. Even if you think whats best is for me to stay at our church, that doesnt necessarily make it so. I took a deep breath and looked away. What Im trying to say is youll be better off without me. I thought I was stronger than I am, but Paul proved that Im not strong at all. I cant handle situations like that, Im too weak. I gazed at her once again, eyes stinging. Im going to leave the church, teach at another Calvary across town. Im going to tell your parents that in a few minutes. If for some reason they say theyd like to follow me over to that church, Im going to advise against it. I think it would be best for all of us. Maybe well meet again in the future. Id like that very much.
From her expression I thought she was going to say shed like that very much too, but she didnt say anything. She leaned into me and wrapped her little arms around me, face pressed against my shoulder. I hugged her back, and now I was weeping.
I tried, Tinkerbelle, I murmured. Theres no reaching him. Hes headstrong.
She released me and we met eyes.
I dont like lying, Mr. Mendelssohn.
Im sorry for making you lie about the other night.
Not that, she said. Well, that too. Pie was the one who told me to tell you not to lose hope with Paul. Remember when I was outside
Yeah I remember. Whos Pie?
My friend.
She unpaused the movie and grinned briefly at me, which was her putting an end to our conversation.

Chapter Twenty One

Can you blame me for not being eager to relate to you that Sunday service at Calvary Chapel? It was to be the last time I stepped foot in that church, and I planned on telling my students that at the end of my lesson. I had my pupils stay in the class room, said Id be back in five or ten minutes, and closed the door behind me. I thought Id get away with it, but thats not the way it turned out. Paul was quick to open the door and conduct the kids into the main room, where they lined up against the wall to listen to what I had to say. I wasnt going to debate it. I was at his mercy. All I could hope for was that he would stick to his word and leave town after my confession. As much as I dreaded what I was about to say, I took comfort in knowing that Trouble was soon to be out of my life, and for good.
Keith Denny opened up in prayer and song. Before beginning his sermon he introduced me to his congregationmost knew me, but not all. He said I had an important word for them. Keith believed I was going to give some uplifting speech of sorts, not the dark history of my past.
I walked solemnly to the lectern, hated that people were applauding me. My students were clapping louder than any of them. As I stood there, my gaze swept over the sea of faces. Paul was seated in the front row, smirking at me. There was no doubt that he was enjoying this tremendously.
I I dont know exactly how to say this, I began. I was sweating. There was utter silence in the room, save for a muffled cough here and there. I want to remind you that we are all sinners. Every last one of us. This includes me. No matter what youve done in the past, there is salvation within reach for us all. Did Jesus not forgive Judas after Judas betrayed him? I am an example of this, of a man having gone astray only to be taken in by the merciful hand of God.
You will be shocked at what I have to confess. But it is important that I do, because there is a message there, one of redemption. Know that I am not the boy I was years ago. The man standing before you is born-again, has been delivered from perdition with the help of the Almighty.
I glanced at Trouble, who nodded his approval.
When I was fourteen I did something I forever have to live with. I I swallowed. My gaze jumped from one face to the next. I laid with a girl. Eyes widened in the crowd. She was thirteen. She wasnt all that bright, was vulnerable and gullible to a fault, and easily manipulated. I did just that, manipulated her into doing what I wanted her to do. We were under a bridge when I took advantage of her. It was short and meaningless, and I felt sick to death at what I had done. Not at first, but the guilt came soon enough.
At fifteen I broke into some cars, stole things. I was a Godless boy. But it wasnt all for nothing. Some good came out of it. I proceeded to tell the story of the ninety-one bucks I stole out of the purse, and how I gave it to a nun, and the miracle that followed it; the money returning to the purse shortly after.
It was that night that I took my parents bible to my room and began reading. It was then that I developed a close personal relationship with God. He forgave me, just as Hell forgive you for any and all sins, if youll but ask.
So that is all I have to say. I wanted to openly confess to you all, so that you might find some hope in my message, that nobody can stray too far from God to be welcomed back. I hope you will forgive me as well, and keep your faith in me. I suppose this is as good a time to mention it as any: this will be my last day at this church. There is a new church under construction at the other side of town, and if it is Gods will Ill become the pastor there. Please pray for me that Im making the right decision, because Im not so sure that I am.
I hung my head and walked away from the lectern feeling about two inches tall. I chanced a glance at Keith Denny, who was overtly discomforted and stunned by my revelation. When the first person began clapping, others joined in. Finally Pastor Denny clapped. As I walked away he took to the lectern, cleared his throat and nervously thanked me for my words, wished me luck on my new endeavor before beginning his sermon.
The kids followed me inside the classroom, the last of the procession closing the door behind her. Shortly after, it opened and Trouble entered.
They took their seats in silence. I wiped my sweaty brow and without thought apologized to them for having to witness that. Nobody said a word, and I could hardly blame them. It was Paul who finally brought a voice to the room not my own. 
He walked to the back door behind me, faced the students and said, Everybody has choices to make. Grave choices. Life-changing choices. Aaron here has made some pretty horrible ones, and now you all have to decide if youre okay with allowing him to teach you about God. Will you guys allow a rapist thief hypocrite to teach you about a God who allowed that little girl to be deflowered in the dirt under a bridge? Your loving God didnt love Marie too much that day, did he? So the choice is yours. You can leave right now with me, which is the right thing to do, or stay here and suffer this pontificating shits lies. Come with me and Ill teach you the right path to walk. One free from hypocrisy.
I said nothing. Truth is, I was afraid of him. He was fourteen and possessed the intelligence of a grown man, and brimmed with confidence. I continued to be at his mercy. Id forever be at his mercy. It wasnt an empty promise that he made under the bridge. Brookes life was in his hands.
Kaitlin stood from her chair. Every head in the room turned to her. She entered the aisle and walked forward, toward Paul. Paul grinned triumphantly.
Anyone else? He said.
Silence.
So be it. Follow the path this asshole is leading you. He smiled at Kaitlin, opened the door and departed with her into the overflow parking lot.
That single empty seat in the middle of the room would mock me the remaining fifty minutes of the eight oclock hour.
My lecture was one I had given months ago, about Adam and Eve, of original sin. It seemed fitting. I spoke not a word of Paul. As far as I was concerned, that boy no longer existed.
It was five minutes before the hour when the back door opened and Kaitlin stepped inside, alone, and returned to her seat, her cheeks tear-scarred. Freddy was seated beside her, rubbing her back consolatory. 
When I released the kids to reunite with their parents, I hadnt intended to keep Kaitlin behind to ask her what had happened. As I said, in my mind Paul no longer existed. I had already begun removing him from my mind and a conversation with this teenaged girl would violate that. But she did stay behind. She waited until we were alone before speaking.
You dont have to tell me anything, Kaitlin, I said. I dont blame you for following him. Okay? I smiled feebly at her. 
I went out there to try to talk some sense into him, she said. I spoke of God and His love. She looked at the floor before her, eyes glassy. Mr. Mendelssohn, I know its wrong for me to say this, but Paul isnt like us. He isnt a boy who will find God. Hes made up his mind. He couldnt understand why I didnt share his point of view. He actually said that he She looked up at me with a grimace. He hates God.
I know he does, I said. Thats his decision. That was courageous of you to try, Kaitlin. It took a lot of guts. More guts than I have. Lets close the door on this chapter now. Hes no longer going to be a part of this church, just as I wont. Things will change for the better because of it. Go on to your parents now.
Im going to miss you, Mr. Mendelssohn. I wish you wouldnt leave. Before I could respond she left.
I wouldnt see Paul Klein again for seven years.

Chapter Twenty Two

I had been the pastor of the new Calvary Chapel for six years, and a substitute teacher for the Fresno Unified School District for four years. Only one child from Sunday school and his parents switched churches, and that was Freddy. I could say they switched because they were eager to be taught the scriptures from me, but that wouldnt be true. They lived closer to the new church, thats all. He was now seventeen. I hadnt spoken to the Stanwicks since I left the church. Occasionally I wondered about Tinkerbelle, who was now a young woman, one who might not remember me, and thats probably a good thing. But I hoped she missed me like I missed her. A kid like her can do that to you, have an everlasting effect on your thoughts and reflections. If I ever suffer dementia or Alzheimers, Id guess that those afflictions couldnt erase that girls memory from my ruined brain, for the better or worse.
Rarely I sermonized about prophecy, about the end times. It can be a frightening topic, and one of much debate, as there are differences of opinion regarding many parts of Revelation. Some interpret the verses to be literal, as others think of them as figurative or metaphorical. I consider every word of that book to be literal. Since the novel Left Behind came out, and its sequels, End Times prophecy had a surge of interest; consequently I had received many requests to sermonize the topic.
It was Friday night and I was in my apartment at my desk, before my computer. I had come down with a cold that Wednesday and was combating it with Nyquil and Tylenol. I figured Id be in better shape come Sunday. I was hammering away at the keyboard, typing up my lecture, having just taken a shot and a half of that nasty-tasting green formula of Nyquil. It may quell cold symptoms, but boy does it make you drowsy. It was ten oclock at night, which was just about the time I go to bed, but I wanted to finish my lecture. I was writing about the rapture, The Great Deceiver, Satans pet the Antichrist. As sobering and portentous a topic as it is, I couldnt have chosen a worse time to write of it, as I was nodding off at increasingly shorter intervals. 
I fell asleep at my desk.
I awoke Saturday morning to a starry screensaver and a vague idea of what caused me to be at my desk instead of bed. I felt marginally better, cold on the decline, but was suffering a wicked neck ache from the peculiar angle at which my head rested against the desktop.
I moved the mouse and my seven pages of work appeared before my eyes. I scrolled up to the beginning and prepared to read it wholly, before deciding to get some food in me and take a quick shower first.
As I showered I recalled the dream I had just awoken from. It was the first time I had dreamed of Paul. I had all but forgotten him, by choice. Six years I had successfully removed him from my thoughts, and all it took was one lousy dream to undo that. In the dream he had aged, had become a good looking young man. He had lured the young woman Brooke to the riverbed, where he decided she was plenty old enough to have some fun with. He used the same lines on her that I fed poor Marie all those years ago, and like Marie she succumbed to his wit and charm, and her blood was added to the dirt as I watched in horror it happening. I watched as if it were a movie, powerless to come to her aid.
I toasted a bagel and in sweats and tee-shirt sat at my desk. I read what I had written, eating my bagel. It was evident where the Nyquil had taken hold of me, as the typos became more and more frequent, and there was some nonsense interspersed in the body of my work. There was a section that was a string of letters where ostensibly I had fallen asleep with my finger pressing the P key. Three lines of Ps with a few Ks ending it. I didnt recall having woken to recommence my writing efforts, but I had written a few pages more before ending abruptly.
Most of what I had writtenespecially the latter portion of itwould have to be deleted as it was nonsense. But the effect of these medicine-induced ramblings was profound. It opened my eyes to the darkest idea I ever had, and that is where I had written Paul Klein in the place of the Antichrist. I didnt believe he was, but it was meaningful that I had written it. Perhaps I was already dreaming of Paul leading Brooke to the riverbed when I typed it; I couldnt say. But once that seed was planted in my head it wouldnt leave. That I was pondering the possibility of Paul Klein being the Antichrist hinted at the impossibility of it. God wouldnt allow mankind to learn of who this evil man is before it was time to know who he is, just as He wouldnt allow us to know when the rapture is, and when Jesus second-coming is. That I flirted with the idea of Paul being the Antichrist was all but proof that he was not. If he was, that idea would have forever eluded me. And besides, I couldnt wrap my mind around the notion of the Antichrist being a youth, just as its difficult to picture Jesus Christ as a teenager. In the scriptures Jesus went from being a youth to being a man, his adolescent years not touched upon. Can you picture it?a young Antichrist? Would he be a sweet little babe, coloring with crayons and telling his mother he loved her? I couldnt imagine it. And when would the Antichrist first consider his destiny? I doubt hed be in first grade learning the alphabet as he secretly knew that one day hed be the vessel which Satan controlled.
Paul was on my mind as I wrote what I did, thats all. Even the string of Ps and Ks intimated that was the case: they were his initials. If Paul wasnt the Antichrist (each time I write Paul and Antichrist in the same sentence it feels more and more absurd), couldnt he be something else? Something not as consequential, but still significant and maybe even profound? He had known things back then when I was a young Sunday school teacher, things he couldnt have known without someone or something enlightening him of things. The door of intrigue that is Paul was re-opened.
I prayed for guidance. I didnt want to obsess over that miserable kid again. I asked God to remove him from my thoughts.
I got to work re-writing my lecture. It took the rest of the morning and a few hours of the afternoon to finish. I read the final product, made a few adjustments and corrections before printing it out. It was going to be a wonderful message to my congregation; I was proud of my work. And I believe God had answered my prayer to remove Paul from my thoughts because I didnt think of him again that day.

Chapter Twenty Three

My cold was gone Sunday morning. I was feeling mighty fine as I drove my Tacoma to church. 
I was pleased to see a great many new faces in attendance that morning. People come out of the woodwork following a pastors promise to speak of the apocalypse. Parishioners tell friends and family who wouldnt otherwise go to church. And those who typically attend church only on Easter and Christmas suddenly find time to make it for this rare occasion.
Today was to be different from most Sundays, in that my one hour sermon was to be an hour and forty-five minutes, just fifteen minutes bridging my morning and afternoon sermons. One hour is hardly enough time to cover all that needs to be covered, and its a bad idea to divide such a lecture into two parts with a week separating them. People have short memories. It needed to be one long uninterrupted sermon. Its more impactful that way.
I planned to sermonize an hour and half, with the remaining fifteen minutes used to call forth all those who havent accepted Jesus as Lord and Savior to come up and accept Him before all. Typically those who come up are those semi-annual church-goers. There are always a good number of people seeking to accept Christ following the message of the second-coming and apocalypse. Atheists might consider this to be a scare tactic, soliciting new parishioners, but you must see it as a positive thing, as those who were lost have now been found. The end of the world is a scary thing, and preaching about it should give urgency to repent and accept Christ.
After singing a pair of hymns I wasted no time delving into the sermon. I felt God guiding me through it, bestowing me the ability to articulate my points well. As I read from my several pages, I frequently glanced up at the crowd, met eyes with various people, several of whom were new faces, and continued along my message.
It was during one of those glances that I spotted a familiar face at the back of the room, leaning against the wall with her arms folded under the bodice of her white dress, one leg hooked behind the other. There were so many people present that this girl wasnt alone in standing at the back of the room, but she was by far the most recognizable to me. Meeting eyes with her wrecked my train of thought. For a prolonged moment I was speechless, my auditors curious at my abrupt cessation. Puzzled heads were turning to the direction of my gaze. I broke eye-contact with Maggie and looked down to my papers and apologized, picked up where I left off. From then on, every time I looked up from my papers my eyes would jump to Maggie. I feared that her presence would inhibit my sermon in some way, out of distraction, but it did notat least not since that initial distraction. 
Honestly I thought there would come a time when I looked up to find that spot at the back wall unoccupied, but it didnt happen. I took a brief pause to sip a bottle of water, while arguing with myself that who I witnessed was someone other than Maggie; someone resembling her but not the angel who had blessed me with her presence twice, and not since that night at the Fresno State Fair.
It was half-past eleven, and I was wrapping up the sermon. I spoke of Paradise, of the believers ascension into the Promised Land. I said there is no time like the present to repent for your sins and accept the Lord as your savior. Like I had done on several occasionsat least once a monthI asked my congregation if anyone here would like to take this opportunity to do just that, to come up and turn their hearts over to the Lord. Sometimes only one or two people come up (never has nobody come up), but I had never been so blessed as I was today, to see better than ten wayward souls stand from their seats and places against the back wall to make their way to the front of the church. I began singing Glory Hallelujah as they ventured forth, and the mass sang along joyfully, supplicating with their hands in the air, palms upward, swaying with their eyes closed.
My smile blinked away when Maggie pushed away from the wall to make her way down the aisle.
When the hymn ended there were eleven people surrounding me. One man dropped to his knees and bowed, wept. The others did the same. A man and woman held hands. They were husband and wife, new to the church.
Praise the Lord! A man cried from the pews. Others echoed that sentiment.
Only one of the eleven before me was not weeping, and that was the girl who I now knew to be Maggie. She was on her knees, praising God ardently. I stepped around the lectern and knelt beside a young woman who was nearly collapsed on the floor. I touched her head and said God bless you.
Another hymn broke out spontaneously. I made my way to the others, the eleven who were making the biggest decision of their lives, and knelt beside them, touched them, praised God for reaching them. I passed over Maggie to the next man and woman, the married couple, and God-blessed them. A man on the floor before me looked up at me and confessed to being a sinner, said he had long lost his way. I assured him that God would forgive him if hed but open his heart and let Him in.
I erected and began walking to the lectern, throwing a glance down to Maggie, who just at that moment looked up at me with those piercing green eyes which seemed to emit a light of their own. She held out a single hand toward me, palm up.
Nervously I stepped to her and knelt, her hand now inches from my chest.
Do you wish to let Christ into your heart? I said and took her hand, placed my other hand on her shoulder, closed my eyes.
God has chosen you, she said inside my head. Just as you seek lost sheep to bring to your flock, another seeks to take those sheep away from God. Recall those mirrors in the Fun House, your distorted reflection. He is a distorted reflection of you. Like you, he has been chosen, but not by God. Your purpose will present itself before you in visions and compulsions. Embrace them, as they are from God. You shall do what He wishes, when the time comes.
Why me? I said inside my head. God doesnt need me to help Him. Dont get me wrong Im honored, but God could just strike him dead if He so chooses.
God will not strike him dead. That isnt to be the course of destiny.
Is he? Is Paul the Antichrist?
If he were, it isnt your place to know. Paul isnt the first man to consort with minions of hell, or The Great Deceiver himself, nor will he be the last. Continue what you are doing, preaching the gospel to the masses. It is your calling, Aaron, for now. But when God tasks you, you will do as He wishes. 
I will. I will do all that He asks of me.
I opened my eyes to the sweet smile of Maggie. With one hand on her delicate shoulder, the other touching hers, she disappeared.
To my parishioners I was a pastor kneeling down and touching someone or something that wasnt there, had never been there. I scanned the crowd as I stood. They were praising Jesus, hands in the air, and not one countenance appeared perplexed at my recent activity.
They were two incredible, momentous hours, as would be the succeeding two hours, where I would have now-fifteen souls around my lectern, supplicating to God. 

Chapter Twenty Four

It was the twelfth of February, 2013, and I had just finished teaching eighth-grade history to a room full of rambunctious kids who thought substitute teachers meant a respite from learning, and license to fun at my expense. I taught six history classes that morning (I preferred teaching English), and was now done for the day. 
It was the beginning of the weekend, and I was giddy. I had been working up the courage to ask out on a date Deborah Leigh, the Human Resources gal at Fresno Unified School District. I was enamored by her, had been since she took the job nearly a year ago. There were times when I had minor issues that could have been resolved by a simple phone call to her, but I had chosen to go to the office to deal with her personally. She was lovely, inside and out, and her ring-finger was delightfully bare.
Four days ago (Monday) I inquired into her personal affairs, asked if she had a boyfriend. I hoped she couldnt tell that I was so nervous that I feared fainting. The way she grinned upon my question was indicative that she suspected my motive for asking. And instead of aggravating my nervousness to an even greater degree, she quelled it; her expression had brightened in a way that suggested that she had been long awaiting that very question from me. She proclaimed to be single, inquired into my own status. I matched her grin when I said I too was single. Too shy to ask her out just then, I said I had to be going and would see her again soon, and looked forward to it. She deflated, visibly dejected, and it was then that I knew wholeheartedly that she wanted to be asked out. Now four days later, today was to be that day.
Just because you sense that youre going to receive an affirmative answer to your proposal doesnt make you any less nervous askingfor me, at least. I was sweating up a storm, moist hands slipping on the steering wheel as I drove to the office. Valentines Day was two days away and I couldnt fathom a more wonderful way to spend it than on a first date with Deborah.
To my dismay she wasnt at the office. Another woman was. She informed me of Deborah being on lunch, wondered if there was anything she could do for me. I said Id just wait for her to return. A half-hour later Deborah opened the glass door to the office smiling at me. Already the best part of my day.
Hi there, I said. Do you have a few minutes?
For you? I dont, sorry. She winked and gestured me to follow her, and into her private office she went, another glass door. I closed it behind us. She seated behind her desk; I sat in one of two chairs fronting it.
Happy birthday, I said right off the bat.
Her eyes widened, corners of her mouth upturned. Thank you! How did you know?
I remember you mentioning it a while back. Truth was, I overheard her telling a co-worker her birthday six or seven months ago when they were talking about signs, astrology. I had made a mental note of it.
Youre sweet to remember, she said affectedly. I dont remember mentioning it. Anyway, what can I do for you today?
Uh I swallowed. I wanted to ask her out right away, but apparently I needed more courage first. I wanted to put in for some time off.
She nodded once, her pleasant expression sobered just enough to hint at disappointment. Disappointment that I wasnt there to ask her out, perhaps.
Sure thing, Aaron. I loved hearing her say my name. She turned to her computer, fingers on the keyboard. Let me just pull up the
Her phone rang. She apologized and answered the phone, entered a conversation. I spaced out just then. I was gazing adoringly at her beautiful face, her full lips, imagining how theyd feel pressed against mine. My gaze drifted down to her shirt, which was buttoned a tad low, which wouldnt have been a big thing if her chest was modestly sized, but it was anything but modestly sized. She was very well endowed. One button too low meant a heck of a lot of cleavage. It wasnt overboard, she didnt look like a tramp, but it was enough to please the discerning male viewer. I felt like a jack ass for looking at her breasts, returned to her eyes, which were fixed on me. She was grinning sidelong. She had caught me staring at her breasts! I felt like a total tool.
For the remainder of her phone call I wouldnt look at her. I looked at the framed picture behind her. It was an Ansel Adams black and white of the Yosemite Valley. Half Dome was centering the photo. I stared at it, daydreamed of climbing it hand in hand with Deborah. I considered that this day, this hour, might start the first chapter of a new life, one shared with the woman speaking on the phone. Might we look back on this meeting ten or twenty years from now and laugh about how I got caught looking at her boobs? And how she denied my date-proposal initially before laughing and saying I thought youd never ask! Yes, lets go out! I sure hoped so.
I envisioned the two of us in a hospital room, Deborah looking harried and spent, a newborn babe in her arms while I filmed with my iPhone, tears in my eyes.
I saw myself walking our son to class on his first day of kindergarten. He had a sack lunch in hand, a lunch prepared by Deborah. I pictured him asking me about Jesus, and me sharing God with him.
I then saw myself driving my Tacoma in the mountains. The sky was dark gray, and it was snowing hard. Was it Yosemite? I thought it was, being that the Sierras were the nearest mountains. Deborah wasnt beside me, though. I passed an Elevation 4,000 Feet sign, followed by a Lake Arrowhead 4 miles sign. I had never heard of Lake Arrowhead. There was a bird with black and white plumage perched atop that Arrowhead sign. As I drove past it, its gaze followed me, wings flitted.
Hello Deborah drawled, waving a hand before my eyes. I returned to awareness.
Sorry.
She bit the side of her lip and returned to her computer, punched some numbers in. So youre going to be out of town this weekend then? She asked. For Valentines Day?
No, why?
Oh I dont know, she said and blushed.
I didnt want to prolong this one second longer. I subdued my nerves just long enough to say: Would you like to go out with me sometime?
Her expression would have been answer enough. Id love to.
I smiled broadly. Great. I was thinking we could do something on Sunday, Valentines Day. But if not, we could get together next week or something; whatever works best for you.
Sunday would be just great. Is that why you requested the next two weeks off? Do you anticipate the date being so horrible that it will take you two weeks at a mountain resort to get over it? She giggled.
Huh?
Nothing, I was kidding. She straightened her posture and placed her hands on the keyboard. So February 15th to March 1st?
February 15th to March 1st? I repeated with a knitted brow.
Is that wrong? Did I hear you incorrectly?
I said those dates?
We wore matching expressions of confusion.
Okay, what did I miss? She asked. I thought you said the fifteenth to the first Lake Arrowhead?
Lake Arrowhead, I said inwardly.
Did you want to give it more thought before committing to those dates?
I was staring blankly at her. I focused and said, No. Those are fine, I suppose.
Do you have family in Lake Arrowhead? I went there once when I was young. My aunt and uncle used to live there.
Where is Lake Arrowhead?
San Bernardino mountains, she said. I must have still looked confused because she added, Southern California? Near Big Bear? An hour or so from L.A.? You are familiar with Los Angeles, right?
Oh. Thats right. Yes, I am.
Are you feeling okay?
Yeah, Im fine. I stood up. Great, so this Sunday, right?
Sure.
We exchanged phone numbers. She said shed text me her address, and seven oclock would be a fine time to be picked up.

Chapter Twenty Five

When I got home I Googled Lake Arrowhead and learned a little about it. I sensed that it wasnt a coincidence that I envisioned myself driving to that town just a moment before Deborah insisted that I had said I was vacationing there. What Maggie had said, that God would grant me visions, that idea returned to me, and I all but knew that this was an act of Him. The question was, why Lake Arrowhead and what was I to do there? And when, exactly? Leave tonight? Next week? I hoped God wasnt wanting me to leave before Valentines Day. The idea of breaking my first date with Deborah was an ugly one.
When I was driving the mountain road in my vision it had been snowing, and hard. That seemed like a good way to estimate the days I was supposed to be down there. I checked Weather.com and it was indeed supposed to snow in Arrowhead, but not till Monday. I was ecstatic. I could leave the morning after my date. 
On Saturday I went to Mens Warehouse to buy a nicer pair of shoes to compliment my suit. I splurged and bought a hundred-dollar pair of black leather ones. The salesman assisting me asked if I wanted to take a look at suits or tuxedoes today. I shook my head no but said yes. It confused my poor helper.
Yes? He said.
Yes was the correct answer, I felt it in my heart. It was a reflexive answer given to me by providence. Yes, but nothing too expensive, please. Im on a budget.
He hooked me up with a cheap tux for just under two-hundred bucks, and threw in a white shirt and red bow-tie.
I left the department store muttering, What in Gods name am I about to do?
The next morning was Valentines Day. The day that would live in infamy, though I couldnt have known it then. I awoke with a smile. Deborah was my first thought, and she didnt leave my mind until my cell phone rang. It wasnt a number from my contacts list, but the area code was my own.
Hello, I said.
Who is this? A girl asked.
Aaron Mendelssohn.
There was silence on the other end. She then whispered, Oh my...
Who is this? I asked.
You probably wont remember me, but I used to go to your church, Sunday school. My name is Brooke Stanwick.
Tinkerbelle! Not remember you? Of course I do! Wow, how the heck are you?
Her voice suggested she was unnerved. A little spooked, I guess. I just intentionally dialed a random number and it ended up being yours.
Really?
Youre going to think Im nuts.
Trust me, Brooke, I wont think youre nuts. Nothing you could tell me would make me think that. Not as of late.
Ever hear a voice in your head, telling you things? But its your own voice?
Yes. Yes I have, I said as a matter of fact.
Good. Im glad. Im not psycho, then. Or if I am, were both psycho.
I chuckled.
I dont know why, she said, but I got it in my head that youre driving to a place called Lake Arrowhead and I should be going with you. That means nothing, right?
I was agape and speechless.
Mr. Mendelssohn?
I cleared my throat. Call me Aaron.
But you arent going to Lake Arrowhead, are you? I dont even know where that is.
I am going. Brooke, I believe God spoke to you.
Are you serious? She sounded excited. Why would He want me to go there with you?
I couldnt say. He must have guided your fingers over the number-pad on your phone. Thats amazing.
It is. Brief silence. Its giving me the chills. I was compelled to pick up the phone and dial a number randomly, after daydreaming about going to Arrowhead with you. Ive never done anything like it. I hope Im not intruding, but would you mind if I went with you today?
To where?
Where else? Lake Arrowhead.
I would say no under any other circumstance, because I feel that I should go there alone, but in light of this how could I say no? If it is Gods will, of course you can go. Only Im leaving tomorrow, not today.
Tomorrow? She registered surprised. But Im pretty sure were supposed to leave today. Like right now. Maybe Im wrong. I sense it though.
Im pretty sure its tomorrow. I saw myself driving up the mountain during a snow storm, and it wont be snowing there until Monday. Let me check online real quick, just to be sure it didnt come early.
A minute later I was staring at the weather forecast with a broken heart. It was snowing today. Id be breaking my date with Deborah. I sighed into the phone.
What is it, Aaron?
Youre right. Im supposed to leave today, I guess.
Were supposed to leave today, you guess.
Yes, thats right. I did some math in my head. Brooke, how old are you, anyway?
Fourteen.
Thats too young. Im sorry. You sound older than that on the phone. I didnt think about how young you are. Your parents would never allow it.
They wont know about it. As luck would have it, theyre out of town till Friday.
Maybe that isnt luck.
Maybe, she said hopefully.
Gosh, Tinkerbelle, I cant believe Im talking to you after all these years. It doesnt bother you that I call you Tinkerbelle, does it?
No, she said and giggled. Its cute. How old was I when we last met, seven? Eight?
Eight.
Youll be in for a surprise when you see me. I was slow to mature, but I really shot up. Im taller than my mom already. Five-foot-seven. Im on the varsity basketball team as a freshman. Cool, huh?
No kidding, huh? I bet youre beautiful. What a dumb thing to say.
The way she breathed into the phone, it made me picture her smiling that charming smile. Nah, Im not beautiful. But thats nice of you to think so.
Want to hear something sad? I asked.
Not really.
I finally got the courage to ask out the woman Ive been in love with for almost a year, and our first date is supposed to be tonight. Oh well, huh?
Aww, that is sad. Im sorry, Aaron.
Eh, its okay. Shell be understanding I think. We can go out next week or something. Or the week after. Im unsure how long Im supposed to be in Lake Arrowhead. I took two weeks off of work without knowing I asked for it. So Im thinking Im to be there for two weeks.
It cant be that long. I have to get back before my parents return.
Oh thats right. I suppose we can come back sooner, then. Hopefully God will guide us. Worst case scenario, Ill drive you home and return down there.
Thats a lot of driving.
Yep.
There was a stretch of silence. I never did tell anyone about what Paul did to me that night, she said.
You remember that, huh?
How could I forget? I have a permanent scar on my temple. Its small, but its a reminder.
Im just grateful that he only hit you and didntI cut myself short. What was I thinking? Dumb, Aaron, dumb! 
Didnt do anything sexual?
He didnt, right?
He didnt.
Thank God, I muttered.
Yes, thank God. Why do you suppose he did what he did? Any idea?
I dont know, Tinkerbelle. I wish I did. Hes just a bad person.
Hes evil.
Yes. I guess I better let you go. I have to make a horrible call, to Deborah. Text this phone number your address and Ill come get you in about an hour. Does that work for you?
Ill be packed and ready. Good luck with Deborah.
I broke the bad news to Deborah. She took it in stride, looked forward to our date, whenever it may be. I probably over-did it with the apologies and asserting that I wanted nothing more than to go out with her, that I simply had no choice, that I had to be somewhere. We ended the call on a high note, and I got to packing. I packed lightly, only two pairs of jeans and some shirts, a jacket. And my new tux and shoes. God would provide.
I found a hotel online, Lake Arrowhead Inn, and called to reserve the room for two weeks. I said I might not stay that long, but I wanted to secure it, just in case. They couldnt promise it would remain available unless I agreed to book it for two weeks and gave a deposit over the phone. I cleared my mind and uttered the first words that popped in my head, issued up like water from a well, and it was Two weeks will be great.
It was ten AM when I pulled onto the road, used my phones GPS to find Tinkerbelles house, which I had been to twice but couldnt recall how to get there.
I parked in the driveway, texted her that Im out front. Nervously I awaited her, imagining what shed look like. I hoped she wouldnt be so pretty that Id have a hard time not staring at her. I suspected shed be just that pretty, or more. When she didnt respond and didnt come out, I turned the truck off and went to the front door, rang the bell. Then rang it again. I waited ten minutes, in which I phoned her a dozen times to no avail.
So be it, I said and got in my truck.
I continued phoning her as I drove to the freeway. I gave up. It wasnt meant to be, I guess. I had a long drive ahead of me, set it off on the right foot with a prayer for guidance and safety, and safety for Tinkerbelle, whom I hoped was okay.
I had an audiobook of Hemingways The Sun Also Rises playing on my cassette-player. I was engrossed by the story when my phone rang. It read Tinkerbelle, a name I input into my contacts list that morning with a smile. I answered eagerly.
Yo, Tinkerbelle, where were you?
Oh, man, Im sorry. Im so embarrassed. Are you on your way down there now?
Yeah, about seventy miles south of Fresno as we speak. What happened?
I was taking a shower and slipped, I guess. I just woke up on the floor of the tub.
Are you okay?
Yeah, Im fine. My fingers are all wrinkly, like prunes.
Id guess so. You took a shower for an hour and a half.
Well crap, she said inwardly. I thought I was supposed to go down with you.
So did I. I guess not.
Damn, she said. Want to hear something interesting? I must have hit my head on the fall, because Im bleeding.
Thats not interesting. Thats alarming. Are you sure youre okay?
Im fine. Whats interesting is where Im bleeding. My temple. The scar on my temple.
That is something, I said meditatively. You werent supposed to go. I think thats pretty evident now.
She inhaled deeply through her nose. Well have fun down there. Maybe we can get together sometime. My parents would love to see you again, I bet.
Yes, well do that. You were the most precious kid, Brooke. Really you were. Probably still are.
Youre sweet to say. Ill let you go. Be safe.
Sure thing. You too. A thought occurred to me before saying goodbye. Wait a sec. Since I have you on the phone, may I ask you something?
No, she said gamely.
Well Im asking anyway, I said jocularly. Maybe you wont remember, being that you were eight years old, but the last time I saw you we were on your couch. You said something that I spent a lot of time thinking about in the following days. You said Pie told you to tell me not to lose hope in Paul.
Pie she said dreamily.
I didnt mis-hear you then? It was Pie?
I didnt say anything about Pie, did I?
Yeah, there on the couch. I dont mean to be nosy, but you had a friend waiting outside of class? I couldnt make any sense of it, and that shed advise you on me and Paul. Vexing, thats what it was. I regretted not asking you about it in detail.
If you had, I probably wouldnt have said anything more. I dont recall mentioning Pie to you.
It was a long time ago. I dont remember much of being eight either.
Pie was my biggest secret.
Like the movie, The Secret Life of Pi? I was smiling.
Actually seeing the commercial for that movie reminded me of Pie. I hadnt thought of her since since about that time, when I was eight.
Did you tell her about Paul and me? Is that why she said what she did? And why was she in the parking lot that day?
What Tinkerbelle then said might have surprised me, but it didnt. Nothing would surprise me much this day. The extraordinary seemed mundane today.
Pie isnt real, Aaron.
What do you mean?
I mean she doesnt exist. Pie was an imaginary friend, my best friend. Or I guess you could say she was my subconscious, though I was too young to figure that out back then.
You know our subconscious minds can be the voice of God, I said. That doesnt surprise me that God would tell you to say what you did. Because He was right to advise me to try to reach Paul. I should have tried harder. Thats cute you thought she was an imaginary friend. Pie, I said and chuckled. God works in mysterious ways, eh?
Yeah
I sensed she wasnt telling me something. Is everything okay, Brooke?
Yeah. Ill let you go. Drive safe.
I drove down Interstate 99 for several hours before merging onto Interstate 5. I drove up the gradient known as the Grapevine. The sharp incline caused the gasoline to shift back in the tank, triggering the low-fuel light in my gauge-cluster. My truck was working hard breasting this hill, so I hoped it wouldnt be too far till the next gas station. It was ten miles before there was an exit with refueling stations, a cluster of them. I began merging to the off ramp before suddenly correcting myself back into the slow lane, without reason or consideration. I swallowed and peered at my gas-gauge: dead on E. A sign read Next Gas 11 miles. I was going to run out of gas.
Are you kidding me? I said. What the heck was that about!
Have faith, I said calmly. I said it, but it didnt originate from within me. Have faith I did, from that moment on.
The needle of the gas-gauge was resting on the peg a good quarter-inch below the E by the time I exited the freeway in Santa Clarita. I expected to run out of gas, and reproved myself for believing that God wouldnt provide for me.
There was a Shell station close by, but I drove past it, turned onto the next street, pulled into an Arco. I got out and stretched, bones popping in my weary back. I slid my debit card in the machine and wed the nozzle to my truck. I squeezed the lever, dropped the catch-mechanism over it, and walked directly toward Manzanita Plaza, which neighbored the gas station. I strode directly to The Party Store, which was the nearest store of the lot. I had ceased being dubious or skeptical or even incredulous. I acted purely on impulse now, and accepted that. There was a Carls Jr in the center of the plaza, its fragrant smoke wafting out of a smoke-stack. I was starving for it. I considered driving through after I was all fueled up.
I milled around aimlessly inside the large store for a few minutes before happening upon a large bin with discounted items inside. Sitting atop the array of party goods was a Halloween costume. It was for kids, a frog costume. I took it, went to the cashier and paid for it. I laughed as I left the store. A kids frog costume? I opened it up and thoughtlessly threw everything away except for the mask.
Maybe this has nothing to do with my purpose, I mused. Maybe this isnt Gods doing but my overactive imagination, or some bad bacon this morning. What sense could there be in having a Halloween costume mask?
I made it back to my silver road-dust-enshrouded Tacoma, removed the nozzle from my truck and cradled it. I glanced at the meter and saw that only five cents worth of gas had made it to my tank. Faulty catch-mechanism. I sighed and gave it another try, slid my card, pressed regular unleaded, and pumped gas. Only another nickels worth of gas made it inside my tank before it clicked off. Broken pump. I got in my truck and started it, hopeful that the ten cents worth of gas would be enough to crank over the engine to move me to the next pump. It fired right up. I pulled forward fifteen feet to the next pump and turned the engine off. As I got out of my truck I glanced at the fuel gauge: full tank. I gawped at it.
Forgive me, Lord, I said. I was wrong to have doubted you.
As I pulled onto the road, I had forgotten about Carls Jr and their delicious burgers. I wasnt hungry anymore. I was satiated and why should that have surprised me? My stomach was another gas tank filled without sustenance. 
Something huge was coming, and not just from the dark clouds blotting out the sky. A storm of another name.

Chapter Twenty Six

I made it to Lake Arrowhead Inn at 3:45PM, entered my second-floor room five minutes later. It had been snowing from below three-thousand feet, rain before that. Fortunately my truck was four-wheel-drive. I had no idea where I was going from here. I asked God to give me the answers, but they werent coming. What did come was a pervading drowsiness. After unpacking my few things, and hanging my tux on a hanger in the closet, I lay on the bed face down above the covers. I fell asleep almost at once.
It was the only dream I ever had in which I knew I was dreaming. Thus so, I was inclined to believe it was a vision from God. My trip then began making some sense, being that I was at a masquerade party. That explained the tux and frog mask. So this must be a premonition, I decided. I was on the bottom floor of a large house, partying with two dozen kids. They were getting snookered, some smoking pot, and all laughing and having a merry old time. I was standing in the middle of the room observing the party, alone, dressed exactly as I had been before falling asleep on my Arrowhead Inn bed. I saw a man seated at the table, alone, wearing a tux and frog mask. That was me! How odd, that I would be seeing myself. Its because it was a vision, I reminded myself.
It didnt take long to conclude that this wasnt a place of God, but teeming with Godlessness. I could look past the underaged drinking and smoking and maybe even the pot, but someone had cocaine, and a couple went inside the bathroom to have sex, and a guy was getting a girl off with his hand for all to see.
A boy was walking toward the other side of the room. I was in his path. I tried to move out his way but wasnt in time: he stepped through me as if I wasnt there. A girl in canary yellow was looking in my general area. I waved at her. She didnt wave back.
There was a man standing by the fire wearing all black except for a white mask. I was mesmerized by his sight. An uneasy sensation of foreboding seized me. Was this man the reason I was here? My gut said yes. I turned to better face him, scrutinized him. A man in a Raggedy Andy mask chanced by him, complimented him on the costume and clapped his shoulder before walking away. A man in a jester mask approached him, put a foot up on the stone footing of the hearth, and spoke to him while swirling the liquid in his cup. I stepped closer to eavesdrop.
Im happy with the turn-out, Jester said to him. He scanned the room approvingly, took a sip of his tonic. When his gaze swept by me, I noticed his hazel eyes. They alarmed me. There was a familiarity to them, I had seen them before. Was he Paul?!
Check that out, Jester said to him and nodded to a spot behind me. I looked back and saw a man in a lion mask molesting black cat. Back cat, who by all accounts was purring. I gaped at the boldness of the lascivious couple. Her legs were damn near doing the splits. His hand obliquely touched her so that the others could better see. A man in a pirate mask encroached on the couple, snapped a picture with his cell phone of a fingers conquest in her smooth-shaven anatomy. I could just imagine the photo circulating on the internet and hoped she wasnt a minor. Or drugged. How on earth could anyone allow themselves to be put on display like that? I was heart-broken for her.
I returned my focus to the duo before the fire. The man in black grinned through me at the girl on the bed. His dark eyes had fire-light dancing in them. It didnt dawn on me just then that he was facing away from the fire, making that reflection impossible. I had a sinking feeling that this man was a supernatural being. Demonic. But demons arent visible to us. That Paul was friendly with himif this truly was Paul, which I was fairly certain he waswas hardly surprising.
I recalled the incident seven years ago in my Sunday school class. The one that quickly got out of hand after I sent Trouble to the corner. Fourteen was too old to be sent to the corner, but he did as I commanded, though I suspect he wouldnt have if he didnt want to. He wanted to be the center of attention, and by being sent to the corner in a ceremony of reprimand he achieved just that. He had called Tinkerbelle panty-girl, having recently given her a wedgie. Freddy came to her defense like the good boy he was, and thats when something happened that I hadnt remembered in years, but it was something that I revisited frequently following the incident, and that was Paul looking up to the vacant air beside him, attentively, and grinning before telling Freddy that God hates kids who kill their hamsters. Paul inexplicably knew that Freddys hamster died; just as he knew I had taken Marie under the bridge at the dry riverbed; just as he knew Id be showing up at that same spot to rescue Tinkerbelle and devised a trap to overpower me. Was the man standing beside Paul responsible for that knowledge? I believed so. And why I felt that why had little to do with rationalization and a whole lot to do with intuition.
I looked over my shoulder to the circle-table, where the real me was seated. Me in the flesh was watching with a soured expression Lion fondle Black Cat. Then he (me) fixed on the man with fire flickering in his eyes. 
I returned my attention to Paul. Jester. He was watching what was taking place on the bed, as were several others. His eyes never left the opened gift under Black Cats dress when he said out of the corner of his mouth, You said shed be here. Oh well, huh? Lucky her, I guess. Paul took a sip, swirled the cup again. I could have Norrah come down here. Wouldnt that be better? That way I could watch.
I looked to the man with white plastic horns attached to his broad-rimmed black hat, expecting him to respond to Jester. But he didnt. Lets be honest here, the man was masquerading as the devil in disguise, and for all I knew, he was the devil. I dont honestly believe that, but I do believe he was something evil. Devil was glaring icily at Black Cat, his grin so wide that his yellowish teeth bared. That coupling of wide energized eyes and maniacal smile instilled a fatal dread in me, as it would anyone.
Yeah, youre right, Paul said. 
Yeah, youre right? I thought. I had been staring at that toothy grin; he hadnt uttered a word. In fact, he hadnt uttered a word yet to anyone that I was aware of. 
A moment later Paul said, Fuck no I dont! Better safe than sorry. A pause. I know, I know. Youre right. Youre always right. He sipped his drink staring at Black Cat.
A few seconds later Paul looked over at his friend suddenly, brow raised. Now? Give me a sec. Im enjoying watching that dude check that chick for ovarian cancer. He laughed. Devil did not. But Devil did appreciate the lewd exhibition taking place on the bed, hadnt taken his eyes off of her since it began, hadnt given that maniacal smile a rest.
Paul reluctantly took his eyes off the girl and faced his friend, said, Are you sure? His gaze was at the fire-glowing half of Devils masked face, whose dreadful expression seemed to be painted on, save for the dancing reflective flames on his dark irises. 
Paul inhaled deeply, exhaled slowly with a nod. He set his cup on the hearth and headed for the stairs, stealing a quick glance at Black Cat on his way, adjusted the tight crotch of his pants.
I was amid the beginning of something momentous, there could be no doubt. 
Devil slowly removed his hat; a tactician in no real hurry, as his rewards are in his work, not their completion. My breath caught, not from anything material but from a sense that something portentous was unfolding. He dropped the hat to the stone hearth, peeled back his white porcelain mask and discarded it. I dont know what I was expecting to seea demonic visage; evil personified, perhapsbut I didnt imagine this man would look unassuming. He was your ordinary Joe in appearance, with the exception of his foreboding expression. It was the expression of a mad man and a deviant. One with a unique array of talents, soon to be on exhibit.
Masquerader #25 tugged one glove off his black hand that possessed long sinewy fingers, then the other. His nails were clawish, lustrous, and jet black. 
Ordinary Joe was ordinary no more. 

Chapter Twenty Seven

I awoke with my cheek on a small puddle of drool. I didnt know where I was at first. It was my hotel room. The digital clock on the stand read 5:12 PM. I went to the window and parted the drapes. It was snowing. The parking lot had been plowed, tall snow banks hedging it. A bird landed on the rail framing of the balcony, just a couple feet outside the window. I thought birds flew south for the winter. It squawked at me. It possessed black and white plumage and a plump little black head, which turned so that its beady little eye could more directly watch me. I recalled from my vision the bird atop the Arrowhead sign, and wondered if this bird was a sign of another kind. 
I closed the drapes and powered on the TV, set it to the news and watched it in bed while eating some beef jerky that I had brought from home. 
I worried that I wouldnt be able to find the house of the party, and what consequence that might have. I worried that even if I did find the house, they wouldnt let me in, being an uninvited guest. If asked I would say Im friends with Mike. Surely there would be a Mike there, isnt there always? I worried what might happen to me if I did get inside the party. Devil had removed his gloves and been poised to to what? Something, surely. All hell was going to break loose, as the saying goes. And who better to break hell loose than Devil?
Thank God Tinkerbelle didnt come. I snatched my phone from the night stand and texted her: Its good you didnt come. Something really bad is going to happen tonight. I couldnt live with myself knowing something bad happened to you because of me.
I finished off my bag of jerky watching a reporter on location at Snow Valley ski resort. Three feet of fresh powder dumped in twenty-four hours. Skiers paradise, the reporter deemed it.
My phone chimed. Tinkerbelle had responded: Can I call you?
I texted an affirmative, went to the closet and took out the ironing board and iron, removed my black slacks from the plastic wrapper and hanger. My phone rang.
Hey-howdy, I said.
Im starting to get a little worried, she said, and I heard it in her voice.
For me? Dont be. Ill handle myself.
Well maybe for you, too. But Im worried because I havent stopped bleeding since I fell.
Brooke, if you need to go the hospital, go!
I I dont know if I need to. Its not bleeding badly. But it hasnt slowed whatsoever. Actually, its gotten
Are you a hemophiliac?
No. I went on WebMD and browsed it, and thats what I found, too. Hemophilia. But Im not one. Ive always been able to stop bleeding on my own.
I hummed. You said its your temple?
Uh huh.
I waited for her to say more.
I told you it was from the scar that Paul gave me, right? She asked.
Yes. 
I think the bleeding has gotten worse. Actually, I know it has. 
Go the hospital. Have your neighbor take you if you dont think its bad enough to call nine-one-one over.
Its not that bad. It was just a little blood seeping at first, but now its trickling. Ive soaked through two towels.
If you dont get help right now, Im going to call nine-one-one for you. Youre worrying me.
I know, thats what I was afraid of. I didnt want to worry you, but when you texted me I figured Id get your advice. If I called my parents theyd flip out, call for an ambulance, and cut their trip short.
How does your head feel?
I have a headache, but of course I do. I fell in the shower, hit my head.
Go get it stitched up. Keep me informed, okay?
Talk to you later.
I remembered seeing the bloody forehead of Tinkerbelle when she was no taller than your average five-year-old. That bastard Trouble had brained her hard with a rock. The gash wasnt very big, but it was deep enough that she had a sheet of blood covering the left side of her face like she laid face-down in red paint.
I couldnt believe how close I had come to bringing her with me on this trip. How horrible I would feel about that decision right now, having just awoken from a dream that forecasted Something Wicked This Way Comes, as Ray Bradbury had so eloquently titled a novel. She would have had to endure seeing Black Cat being taken advantage of, for starters. And the couple swaggering into the bathroom to fornicate. It was no place for an innocent fourteen-year-old. Following that thought was the idea that Brooke would be seeing Paul once again. Paul, who once threatened to kill her if I didnt do as he said. What else was it he had said? That he wouldnt rape a little girl, but if she was a few years older he might? Yes, and he said Brooke was likely to be hot when she grew up. Thank God she didnt come with me.
A sudden thought hit me like a charged live-wire, its impact no less powerful. It was what Paul said to his evil friend before the hearth: You said shed be here. Oh well, huh? Lucky her, I guess. Who had they anticipated coming? Is the answer to that question pressing a blood-soaked towel to her temple this very moment? If so, it begs the question: who had given her the vision of accompanying me on my trip down here? I thought it had been God, or an angel. But now I wasnt so sure. Although I couldnt say definitively, I thought I knew who had prevented her from coming with me on this trip. Divine intervention caused her to slip in the shower, as well as provide her with some kind of stigmata in the form of a reopened gash. Maybe I was wrong, but my gut said I was right.
On the heels of this revelation was another: if Paul sought to lure Brooke down to the party, that could only mean that he knew I was coming. I didnt know how I felt about that.
I ironed my tux, took a shower and got dressed, prayed for my safety, the partiers safety, and Tinkerbelles safety.
The uncertainty of everything was maddening. What was supposed to go down at the party and why was I sent here? Because Paul was going to be there? Why did that matter? 
My guts were all in a knot as I closed the hotel door behind me, got in my truck. I wanted this day to be over, for it to be tomorrow. How crazy a notion it was that I was about to go to a party that I hadnt the foggiest idea where it was, but I knew Id be there just the same. God would guide me. That God would guide me gelled my conviction that I was doing the right thing, that I needed to be here tonight. I was serving His purpose, and I would die for that purpose if it was my destiny. My reward would be waiting for me in Heaven.

Chapter Twenty Eight

As I drove aimlessly over a recently plowed road, I did a lot of thinking, some introspection. How important was it that I was right here, right now? How did this all come to be? I hadnt even heard of Lake Arrowhead when I daydreamed it two days ago. I had just been caught gandering at Deborahs chest, embarrassed but not too embarrassed to inhibit me from having a vision. I was driving up the mountain, the sky gray and ominous, snowflakes sifting down, not yet dumping. The bird on the Arrowhead sign. The same species of bird that was outside my hotel room, a magpie. Was it an omen?
I gasped and instinctively hit the brakes, cutting loose the back end of my truck, which slid out and threatened to send me into the snow bank curbing the side of the road. I released the brake and gassed it a little, just enough to regain some traction to propel me away from the looming snow bank. My heart raced, and not from sliding on the road. I needed to make a phone call, but it would have to wait until I got off the road; Id need my focus on driving just to keep from wrecking.
I had the epiphany less than a mile from the place of destiny, Norrahs homethough I didnt know the home owner to answer by that name just then. Thankfully it was near, because I was busting at the seams by the time I parked toward the end of the cul-de-sac. The idea that caused me to nearly crash was eating at me, and wouldnt subside until I could speak with Tinkerbelle.
I left my truck idling, heater on high, and called Brooke.
Hello, she said, upbeat.
What did Pie look like, I asked.
Pie? I told you, she isnt real. Like you said, she was my subconscious.
Do subconsciouses manifest themselves? She wasnt all inside your head, was she?
In her hesitation was the answer, confirmation.
I dont know, Brooke said.
Dont be shy about it. What did she look like?
Why? Why do you want to know?
Because, Brooke, I believe I know your little friend Pie. She isnt as imaginary as you think. Did she have brown unbrushed hair and bright green eyes, eyes that almost seemed to glow?
Brooke inhaled sharply.
May I take a stab at guessing how her name came to be Pie? I didnt wait for a response. I dont think thats her name. I think her name is Magdalena, or Maggie, and from that Id guess you thought it would be cute to call her Magpie, and eventually Pie.
Yes. Yes!
I exulted with a fist-pump.
Shes real? Brooke asked. But she cant be real!
I dont know how I missed that earlier. Maggie had wanted me to remain you kids Sunday school teacher, insisted that it was Gods will. It was my calling, though I shunned it. Its hardly surprising that shed have you try to convince me of the same thing, knowing how much I adored you. Unfortunately it didnt work. I can only guess at the fatal outcome of what I did, of abandoning hope on Paul.
Paul was hopeless, you couldnt have changed that.
Says you. Says me. But God thought otherwise. Maggie thought otherwise. Anyway, Im here at the party now. Ill have to let you go.
Party? What party?
I dont know, a masquerade party.
Whose? What are you doing there?
No time to explain things. Actually, I couldnt explain things anyway. Ill fill you in later. I just had to call you to verify that your Pie is my Maggie. Very cool. I knew in my heart of hearts that Maggie was real, even though my dear friend Abbey couldnt see her. I knew she was real, but by you sharing with me what you did verified her existence to me.
Magpie is real, she said dreamily. Shes an
You can say it. Shes an angel. Ill talk to you soon. Take care, Tinkerbelle.
I ended the call and quit the engine. Lining both sides of the dark street hedged with tall snow banks were several cars. A narrow street made narrower by the snow banks, made far narrower from the string of parked cars. I was parked behind a yellow late-model Pontiac GTO. Not the kind of car you want to drive in a snow storm. The only light in the area came from a frosted-glass fixture on the porch of a house fifty yards away. There was a house directly to my right, but it was nothing but a hulking shadow, no lights on inside. I stepped out of the truck and walked toward the music, which was faint at this great distance. 
I nearly fell on my ass from the shock that was a voice bellowing, Hey! What are you doing! just a couple feet from my ear. I flinched, looked to the yellow car beside me. A guy in a Batman mask and girl in a Catwoman mask were laughing hysterically inside the GTO, the drivers window cracked open, and now rolling down fully in a hum.
Sorry, dude, Batman said after flipping his mask up on top of his head. Just messing with you.
I smelled the strong skunky stench of marijuana pouring out of the cabin. 
You scared the crap out of me, I said.
Sorry, bro. Hey, want a toke off this? Its good shit. He offered the joint.
No, Im fine. I uh, already smoked some earlier.
Sweet. See you inside, man.
I began walking toward the house, feet already turning into popsicles through the thin soles of my wingtips, padding across a fresh inch of snow blanketing the asphalt. I stopped and turned my head, saw Batman hand Catwoman the joint. She raked back the mask from her face as well, held the joint to her mouth; the tip glowed a hypnotic orange. I returned to the open window of the GTO.
Hey, can I ask you something? I said.
Shoot.
The girl coughed violently as she passed the J back to her date.
Is Paul hosting this party?
No, Taylor is. Oh wait no youre right. Paul is hosting this party, isnt he?
Yeah, the girl replied. Why?
I stood is silent thought for a moment. Whats he like? Paul.
You dont know him? He puffed the joint.
Hes a dick, Catwoman decided. Not really, but kind of.
Batman coughed, said, No, he is a dick, youre right, and coughed some more.
A sexy dick, though, the girl said and grinned devilishly, slid provocatively her tongue over her upper lip, then laughed at her dates reaction.
You bitch! Batman said and laughed with her. I dont care. So what, girls like him. He looked me in the eyes and said, Doesnt matter though, bro, because you know what? Brandy here is going to bed with me tonight, not him. Am I right, man? He was smiling proudly at me.
Yeah, I said with feigned enthusiasm. Youre right. Right on, right on. So how long have you known Paul, and whered you meet him?
I dont know, a few months ago I guess. At a frat party. He goes to the same school we do: University of Redlands.
He isnt a student there, Brandy (aka Catwoman) informed. At least thats what Marissa told me. He just pretends to go there.
Really? Batman said bemused. Why would he do that?
Brandy shrugged, gestured for her date to pass the joint back over. He did, and she wasted no time ripping a toke off of it.
How do you know him? Batman asked me.
Same way. At a party, I lied. Does Paul ever talk to you about I dont know, religion or anything like that?
Fuck no, Batman said grinning up at me. The only time he mentions God is when he says goddamn.
Brandy howled laughter, a laughter amplified by THC.
As much as I hated that word, I had to admit, that was pretty clever. I humored with Batman. 
Ill let you guys go, I said. See you inside.
Yep. Hey bro, did you forget your mask?
Oh yeah. Thanks.
I walked back to my truck, unlocked it and got inside. I watched as Batman and Catwoman got out of the car parked directly in front of me and slowly sauntered down the white street, careful not to slip. He pinched her ass and she hopped up and swatted his hand away. He laughed and did it again. I shook my head at them with a grin. 
My toes were numb. I decided to start the engine and crank the heat on to defrost my feet, turned the knob to floor-mode and kicked off my shoes. My daytime running lights activated with the engine, illumined the street a great deal before me, reflecting the snows blinding whiteness back at me. I wished I hadnt turned my truck on. The stoned couple twenty feet or so into the beaten track of my headlights looked back at me. It was a spotlight for some new shenanigans. Batman took advantage of the situation by reaching down to the hem of Brandys black dress and pulling it up. She slapped his hand and shrieked, then laughed. He tried again, with the same result. She flipped him off before flashing me anyway, defiantly, pulling her dress all the way up to her stomach and doing a full circle. She wore a white thong. What bothered me about it wasnt the immorality of the act, but that I couldnt look away from what I was seeing, her alluring figure. It was Satan working on me, enticing me, tempting me, and I was giving in to temptation. I like to think that only a piece of forbidden fruit that ripe could stray me from the path of righteousness. If hell was to be occupied by a multitude of women looking like that, Satan could do worse than making pamphlets with her on the cover, posed just as she was a second ago, turning a circle with her dress above her waist, little white cotton panties. Like it or not, the image would be forever tattooed in my memory.
She lowered her dress. Batman gave me a thumbs-up and cheered, Yeah! What an ass, huh? Remember what I said, bro! Tonight shes in my bed, not Pauls!
Upon mention of Paul, Catwoman lifted the skirt of her dress to just below her waist and gyrated her hips, miming intercourse with Paul.
I gawked at her. This was a new breed of people to me. Wholly unabashed and shameless. Proud, even. Bodies not temples but drive-throughs. They were children in heat. I wondered if it would be so bad if something horrible did happen to these kids tonight. Did God not scourge the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah for the same reason? Maybe sometimes the slate does need to be wiped clean.
Youre a hypocrite, man, Paul had once said to me. He was right, I am a hypocrite. Im supercilious, looking down on these kids like Im better than them. But what had I done just twenty short seconds ago? I imbibed fervently the sight of Catwomans lower-half in all its splendor, those milky long slender legs and full glutes, and it aroused me. And in my dream I watched Lion fondle Black Cat. I was aghast, yes, but that didnt stop me from staring at the deed, did it? Not at all. Im a hypocrite. For the first time in my twenty-eight years, I admitted that to myself.
The heat was doing more than defrosting my toes, it was cooking my feet, and it felt sublime. I put my shoes back on and shut off the engine. It was time.
I was heading toward the side of the house, where I had seen the two kids go a minute ago. The window in front (the center of three stories) had blinds which were open, kitchen lights on. I looked inside as I walked, stopped when I spied a woman. She had just entered the kitchen from a larger room, and was now pouring wine into a glass. She was older than Batman and his luscious date, around my age. Dressed plainly enough to know that she wasnt there for the party, but instead was the presumed home-owner. She noticed me through the corner of her eye, looked over at me directly. I resumed my pace at once. Peeping Tom? Sure, why not. I was feeling like a real jerk. She assuaged that feeling with a smile and wave at me. It wasnt a polite smile but a sincere one. What a lovely woman, I thought. I waved back before disappearing behind the corner of the house, where it became so dark I could hardly see. I descended the slope using the wall for support, lest I slip on the snow and fall flat on my butt. The snow was deep here; I used the scarcely visible tracks of the preceding guests so I wouldnt be walking through deep powder.
The music was getting loud as I neared the back of the house. I lowered the Frog mask from the top of my head to my face. There was a patio under the second-floor deck free from snow, but not free from guests. I rounded the corner to meet the company of a boy and girl. Here the lighting was provided through large windowpanes by a well-lit basement. 
Hey guys, I said coolly.
Hey, said Bunny. I got to pee. She went inside, leaving the door open.
Whats up, Frog? Mouse said buoyantly, as if I was an old friend instead of a stranger.
Not much, amigo. I had to raise my voice to contend with the music. How goes it?
It goes, it goes. Cold as shit, huh? He sipped from his red cup.
Yeah it is. Is it any warmer inside?
Yeah, body heat, the best kind, he said. He reached out to shake my hand, saying, Im Dust He cut himself off. Whoops. I keep forgetting we arent supposed to use our names. Im Mouse. The peeer who just went inside is my girl, Bunny.
Bunny, huh? Nice.
My little Playboy bunny, she is.
Hows the party?
Just got here ten minutes ago, but it seems cool.
Sweet, I said. I havent seen Paul in years; cant wait to see how hes been.
He nodded, sipped his drink. Years, huh? Youre the first guy Ive met whos known him longer than longer than this spring semester, I guess.
Is that so?
Hes the new guy on campus, so to speak. Everyone talks about him. Chicks dig him. Hes with a new chick every time I see him, and theyre always knock-outs.
Knock-outs, huh? Like Bunny? And Catwoman?
You think theyre hot? Mouse asked with a twitch of his brow.
Im sorry, I didnt mean to say that about your girlfriend. That was rude of
Dude, dont worry about it, he said with a disarming grin. I take it as a compliment. And yes, Brandy is gorgeous. I mean Catwoman. Under his breath he said, What I wouldnt give for ten minutes alone with that.
Really? But you have Bunny. If you dont mind me saying, shes a perfect ten.
Oh yeah? Thanks, man. Yeah, shes smokin, but Catwoman is different. Strange always trumps been-there-done-that, know what I mean? He put a cigarette in his mouth and lit it.
I nodded, though Id never relate to him, couldnt empathize in the slightest with how he felt, which was jaded. Jaded to have won the affection of a gorgeous woman who was racking up the miles on the odometer and about due for a trade-in on a new lease. Or a Certified Pre-Owned, like Catwoman. Hell, maybe Mouse and Batman could trade pink-slips. I looked over the railing to the blackness of forest. The girl returned outside and draped a limp arm over Mouses shoulder, grinned intoxicatedly at me.
Feel better? I asked.
Much. Froggy. Im going to eat some frog legs tonight. What say you to that?
Ouch?
The couple laughed.
Ill talk to you guys later, I said and headed for the door. Be safe.
Always, Mouse said.
I stepped foot inside and for a moment was overwhelmed by dj vu. It wasnt dj vu, but something similar. It was the sensation of having been in this room, even though I hadnt. It was from my dream. It was more confirmation that I was on the path of destiny. For better or worse, I was where I was supposed to be. I gazed around the room, taking in the sights of diverse masqueraders. There was Black Cat, laughing with Canary. I wondered if she had already been excavated there on the bed, or if that was yet to come. I remembered seeing myself seated at that small circle table, watching Lion do what he did, and decided that the deed hadnt yet occurred. 
I appreciated Black Cats physical beauty, and as I surveyed the room I appreciated the good-looks of boys and girls alike. Maybe it was the formal attire, but I didnt think so. Paul had invited the cool crowd, it seemed, which almost exclusively consists of beautiful people. I was an outsider looking in, in every aspect this evening.
What is Paul planning for you all, I wondered. A better question is what does Pauls friend plan for you all? Whatever it was, they were in on it together, those two. In my dream Paul had said he should get Norrah to come downstairs, that way he could watch. The lovely lady upstairs whom I peeked at through the window must be Norrah. What could it mean that she should come downstairs, that way Paul could watch? Watch what? Watch Black Cat get molested? That was my own flaring hormones talking. No, it wasnt that. He was to go upstairs and not bring Norrah down. It was a puzzle I couldnt solve, not enough pieces in place.
You French, Froggy? A guy said at my side. He wore a mask with colorful feathers and glitter. A showgirls mask. 
No, why?
You know, they call the French frogs.
Oh. I put my hand out and said, Names Aaron.
No names, comrade. No names. He shook my hand.
Oh yeah.
Dude, he said, Im looking to score some E. Got any? Or know anyone who does?
Whats E?
He grimaced. Never mind. He walked away, clapped the back of Raggedy Andy and got to work needling him for a possible source of E.
There was Pirate, Elephant, Bulldog, Raccoon, Princess, Fairy I began counting them for no reason. Thirteen on that half of the room. Canary, Black Cat, Leopard, Catwoman, Jester, Devil there were nine on the other half. Behind me, outside on the patio, was Mouse and now Phantom. Twenty five in total, including myself.
I threaded through the crowd to the table, slid a red cup off the stack and poured myself a cup of tonic and ice. A loud rock song played. Some people moved to the beat, not dancing but something less than that. The cigarette smoke from outside wafted in. I smelled something not cigarette smoke, something sweeter. Pot. I sipped my tonic as I ambled across the room, grinning and nodding at anyone who made eye-contact with me. I then met eyes with Jester. Paul. His were welcoming, grinning at me. He knew who I was. Id rather he frowned at me. We were still looking at one another when Butterflyher mask a colorful glittery spread of four wingstapped my shoulder, stealing my attention away.
Yes? I said to her.
Toby?
No, sorry.
Oh.
Hey, do you know who that guy is by the fireplace? I asked in an undertone.
What? The music was too loud to conduct any kind of surreptitious conversation.
I stepped into her; she moved her cup away to accommodate my closeness. I put my mouth to her ear and said, Do you know who that guy is by the fire? Standing beside Jester. With the horns.
She looked in that direction, which was around me. She put her mouth on my ear. I felt her wet lips nuzzling my ear, and it sent a tingle down my spine.
I dont know. I like his mask, though. She lapped at my earlobe once, playfully.
I felt it in my groin, pulled back from her. She wore a wry grin. It went well with what she then said: Want to take me upstairs?
I swallowed dryly. For what?
She had just taken a sip of her cocktail when I said it. She laughed and spit out some of the drink.
Im sorry, I said.
So am I.
She turned away from me, spied a friend of hers and raised her hands in the air, grinded her hips in a kind of dance move. Canary she drawled.
I took a deep breath and risked a glance at Jester. He was still watching me. Probably hadnt stopped since first laying eyes on me. Still wore that same pleased expression. Beside him Devil glared at me. His wasnt a pleased expression. I looked away at once, thought it would be a while before I looked in that direction again. How impossibly sinister his presence was, irrationally so.
There was now a song playing that people were intimately familiar with the lyrics. The sum of them sang along. With my back to Paul and his cohort, I stepped to the nearest window, beside the small table encumbered with booze, and looked outside the dark windowpane. Phantom and Mouse were just beyond the patio, standing on a bank of snow, looking up to the deck above us, conversing with Norrah. 
The throw of yellow light from that upper deck fanned twenty or so feet into the forest before becoming dark impenetrable night. Phantom and Mouse stood a couple feet apart, facing me, their cheerful faces gazing up at Norrah. 
My eyes doubled at what I saw between them, well beyond them. A little white ghost of a personage blending in perfectly with the snow, save for her dark hair and green reflective eyes, standing at the farthest reach of the light, between the trunks of two large Pines.
I rushed to the open door and stepped outside.
A woman laughed above me, a soothing musical laughter. Well see, she said. What are your names? Im Norrah.
Phantom, Phantom said.
Mouse, the other said. We cant give our names, its the rule.
Okay, Mouse and Phantom, said the woman above, invisible to me. Maybe Ill come down for just one drink in a few minutes.
Right on, Phantom said.
The two masqueraders flanked me and went inside, closed the door. I was alone out here, save for the woman on the deck above me. The sliding glass door opened and closed. I was now absolutely alone, in the physical sense. But not in the spiritual sense. Down the snowy slope, between the pines and catching very little light was Magdalena.
Hi, I said nervously at her.
Her somber expression was wooden. Her white dress billowed with the wind, as did ribbons of her brown hair. One lock of hair caught at her cheek, tip whipped around her chin and flitted like the forked tongue of a snake. She wore no shoes, stood barefoot on the snow. As if she were weightless, she didnt recess into the powder.
Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, she said disappointedly. The music did nothing to obscure her voice, nor did the distance separating us. I couldnt be sure her voice wasnt all in my head, even as I saw her mouthing the words. Are you losing your way, and so soon?
No, I contended. I mean I I dont know. Maybe I am. 
I hung my head, glimpsed up shamefully and was relieved to see her turn a smile.
Lets chat, shall we? She said.
I went through the narrow division of rail, up the steep bank of snow, crushing down into it. I stood in place momentarily. The coldness of snow rushed through the leather of my shoes, numbing my toes almost at once. I continued on, stamping a single set of tracks into the snow, not wondering why there wasnt a second smaller set of tracks leading to her. I arrived before her, between the trees, and stopped. From her shadowy visage shone green eyes, a source of meager light all their own.
You are not so unlike the others here, she began.
I didnt need to ask what she meant. I was ashamed, nodded.
Another hour or so and might I find you upstairs with who was she? Butterfly?
I wouldnt do that. Look into my heart and see for yourself.
She nodded with marked satisfaction. What you thought earlier, she said, about Sodom and Gomorrah, and wiping the slate clean. Very perceptive.
Oh no please dont tell me thats whats going to happen.
And why shouldnt it?
Because they dont deserve that!
She stared silently at me, green eyes glowing dimly, churning with supernatural energy.
Ill do what Im supposed to, but please dont take them away, I said desperately.
Are you pleading with me or with God? I am not He. It is His decision to make.
Then why am I here? What purpose does it serve for me to be here? Am I to be one of the those punished for sinning?
God is punishing no one. It isnt He who has designs against your peers. It is another.
Pauls friend, I surmised. Devil. 
God and God alone has the power to act against it. But why should He?
I dropped to my kneesmy warm knees melting the snow around them, soaking my slacks with freezing waterand prayed my hands together, looked up at the pitch black sky and swaying boughs of pine needles.
I prayed, begged God to keep these kids safe. I wont relate all my pleas, but there were many. The voice of God is our subconscious, and my subconscious showed me the path to walk. Gave me direction. I was tasked, and obliged to take up that task. It is such a deeply personal thing, the words I received from God, that I could in no way violate my conscience by repeating them to you my reader. They were words between He and I, and shall remain in confidentiality. But this sacred vow I took shouldnt affect the following pages, Ill see to that.
I was on my knees in the snow, weeping in my hands. Upon saying Amen there was a hiccup in time, a disconnect between what I had been doing and what I was now doing. I was at the back door, looking down at the knob. I touched at my knees, the fabric of my slacks dry and warm. My feet were warm. I glanced over my shoulder; Maggie wasnt there. I checked my wristwatch: 8:52 PM. Id step inside to make it twenty-five masqueraders in the room of destiny.
