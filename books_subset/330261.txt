Part 1  Of Images and Angels
Chapter 1
No Pulitzers here, but maybe something that would keep him from going hungry.
Preston was reviewing the images from the last three days of whizzing around The Hague. He did his best to avoid the touristy stuff and captured angles with an artsy edge. His work filled a very narrow niche that saw the wire services buying sometimes almost as much as ten percent of what he submitted.
The park behind the Noord Hove shopping center was relatively quiet that morning. He had been wandering all over Zoetermeer since dawn with the help of a district tourist map and a borrowed bicycle. His camera was recent technology, but still on the low end of the price range. He bought it because it was the most he could get in such a tiny pocket digicam.
For the third time he reminded himself he really should carry the laptop on these forays. The bigger screen would make it much easier to discard images with major flaws. It would take him awhile but he decided to head back to the village where his host was part owner of an inland marina. The tiny village of Hoogmade sat among the polders east of Leiden just off the A4.
As he pedaled along the narrow lanes, zigzagging his way in a northerly direction, his mind wandered back over the events that brought him there.
Two decades ago as a freshly minted soldier, he hadnt even known that there were US military installations in the Netherlands. He worked maintenance in one of the not-so-secret forward storage sites for heavy military vehicles. His post was several acres of steel warehouses surrounded by blacktop and high security fencing; his job was a mind-numbing boredom of rotating the aging vehicles in and out of storage for routine inspection and lubrication. Occasionally someone up the chain of command mandated an upgrade of some component, then back into storage it went.
On the other hand, it was as close to a paid vacation as you could get in the military. The Dutch were wonderful hosts, the country wide open to exploration and he was officially encouraged to take full advantage of it. Prestons photography hobby was a prime excuse for blindly grabbing a train headed somewhere new and he saw most of the Lowlands during his tour. Eventually he bought a nice mountain bike and light backpack for longer jaunts overnight, sometimes taking in on the train. He made a lot of new friends, but one in particular became a lifelong buddy.
During one of his long rides he found himself on the shore of a large lake at the foot of three conical cooling towers. Nuclear energy had always been big in Europe. Out on the lake in a stiff breeze were a large number of wind-surfers. Apparently it was some kind of competition. When he pulled out his camera and began seeking a good angle, someone called out to him from atop a rather large enclosed cargo van. The fellow had backed as close as permitted to the edge of the water and stood on top. He had a tripod supporting a rather ancient VHS video camera.
Preston found the Dutch typically eager to speak English, but he decided to learn as much Dutch as possible, careful to mimic the sounds he heard. It prevented a quick stop from turning into a long conversation when he didnt feel like hanging around some place. This fellows patter was loaded with too much jargon, so after a couple of comments while the man gestured to a built-in ladder on the back door, Preston called out in English.
How come you arent out there riding the wind with the rest of them?
Without breaking stride, the man switched to English. Im the primary sponsor of this event!
Between getting some good shots, helping the man get more from his video equipment and enjoying a few beers, they became fast friends. Preston learned the man called himself Harry for some odd reason, though it bore no relation to any part of his real name. The fellows family had been nautical builders from way back, even bearing the name Botenbouwer (roughly translated as Boatwright). Harry insisted on paying him in advance for some large photo prints of the event. The family business near Leiden became a frequent stop for Preston on his wanderings over the years while stationed in the Netherlands.
So that was long ago, and Harry had kept in touch when Preston returned stateside. Preston kept working in heavy equipment maintenance as a civilian, becoming a manager quickly. However, he never lost his love for photography. He spent a lot of time online with other photography buffs and kept in touch with Harry through nautical forums and email.
You would have thought it would go on like that forever, but at some point Preston stumbled across the manosphere on the Net. As he began implementing the changes, his pushy wife was not amused. She pretended it was just another hobby, but Preston took it to heart and the friction became unbearable. She refused to change. It was an ugly divorce and the courts ruled against him 100%. She moved her toy-boy into the house while he was on a business trip and changed to locks on the doors. He found most of his personal belongings had been delivered to the hunting lodge he shared up on the mountains. He stayed there while tying up the loose ends.
Preston had prepared well. He had already made a deal to sell all his assets on short notice, written up and dated before her move, so she ended up with the physical property only. The house and car she had were already paid off, so he felt no further obligation to her. Preston decided it was a good time to take Harry up on his offer to photograph the test run in the North Atlantic for a new sloop design. The one remaining teenage daughter at home begged Preston to take her with him, but he didnt want to defy the court decree directly, having skated around the edges of it so much already.
So Preston shipped out with Harry and his crew, and the voyage ended up back home in the Netherlands. Preston lived frugally and began selling some of his images wherever he could, hoping he could avoid touching his hidden offshore accounts for a couple of years. With so many banks collapsing around the world, he wasnt sure hed ever see the money, anyway. For now, he was biking through the regions around The Hague and taking lots of pictures.

Chapter 2
It was that woman again.
The first time Preston ran across her was in Katwijk. He had been trying to capture the ancient cathedral near the beach with some sails in the background. At one point he was lying on the sidewalk with his camera resting on a loose brick he found nearby. Out of the corner of his eye a figure rode by and he waited for her to clear his frame.
The gal was striking, though not in the sense of grand beauty. Pretty enough, sure, but she was possessed of a very incongruous set of features. Diminutive, she was riding one of the smaller framed bikes typically used by older children. However, she was not petite, but rather muscular like an athlete. Her middling shade of brown skin was common enough among the cosmopolitan Dutch, but it was matched with entirely Caucasian facial features and beautiful flowing red hair. For a moment he wondered if it could possibly be her natural color, but then turned back to his photo composition.
Apparently her image lingered in his mind, because he could have sworn he saw her again in Wassenaar when he was out at the Duinrell campground taking pictures of some of the unusual characters occupying the old horse track during a celebration. He saw here up near the rental office. The next week he was near Voorschoten photographing the shooters festival  men firing low powered .22 caliber rifles at tiny round blobs on a frame mounted at the top of a very long pole. The festivities included some deliciously creative military styled uniforms copying elements of just about every uniform men had worn in Western military history since firearms were introduced. He spotted her in the crowd just a few meters from where he stood.
He almost went up and spoke to her, but decided against it. Instead, he decided to test the limits of coincidence. Waiting until after dinner time one evening, he skipped the bike and grabbed a seat on a bus headed to Alphen, and from there took the train south to Gouda. It was a short hike to the old city center. He sat at a table in the triangular old market plaza, which was dominated by a baroque looking city hall he had seen too many times in photographs already. He waited and watched as the traffic nearly disappeared and some of the nightspots closed. Paying his tab he walked along the northern edge of the market plaza and threaded his way through the ancient streets to the Rotterdamsweg traffic circle, and then south across the river.
Taking the southerly route, he hiked out across the bridge to the Kattendijk and followed it south out of town along the IJssel River. By now it was dark and the moon was setting early. In its first quarter, he was hoping to catch it against the roof of an ancient farmhouse across the river from him. There was still time to find a good angle which placed him along a fairly straight stretch in the channel. He sat hunched down in some tall grass along the road. It was very quiet and nearing midnight.
As the moon began to approach the ideal angle above the horizon, he heard a canal barge approaching from the right. There were a few old boat pilots around who knew the channels well enough to run them at night, but never without lights. This one was unlighted and he could barely make it out. Suddenly the motor sputtered and died and the barge slowed visibly as a dark mass in the water below him. He was curious. Since his camera was capable of capturing images in low light conditions without a flash, he steadied it on his knee and aimed the lens at the boat. His finger found and pressed the compose button, one click down. After a couple of seconds, the scene became just visible to him. Someone stepped out of the pilot booth and onto the deck behind it, which was the roof of the cabin.
Something in Prestons instincts twitched his finger to press the button down to the second click, which recorded in video mode.
The figure reached down and began dragging a heavy load of some kind. Preston could just make out a long duffel bag, almost as big as the man dragging it. Stopping at the rear of the deck, he looked down at his load, then squatted to change his grip. He wrapped loose fabric from the bag in each hand across the middle. Hoisting it, he turned around completely. Then, keeping the load behind him, he took two very quick steps, twisted his body and heaved the load over the side. One end struck the gunwale on the way down, flipped and sank into the water. The figure watched as only bubbles rose to the surface; the boat drifted downstream away from the spot.
Then the figure turned back toward the wheelhouse and stepped inside. The engine coughed and came to life, driving the barge with fresh momentum down river again. As it reached the next bend, the lights came on and there was no sign anything had happened. That is, except for the video footage of the incident in Prestons camera, which ended as the barge passed before him and he captured the name painted in bold letters across the stern.
He sat staring in the grass waving in the breeze directly in front of him. What did he just see? He had the laptop with him this time, but he suddenly felt the urge to get as far as possible from this spot.
It was at the moment his muscles tensed to drive him upright that he heard the female voice. Heeft hij motorpech hebben?
While his brain translated reflexively the question about possible motor trouble, he was too surprised to answer in kind. I wouldnt count on it, he said as he rose to his feet. He turned to see the short sturdy redhead on her bicycle. He continued, The pilot shut the motor off on purpose, then tossed a heavy bag into the river, just about the size of a human body.
She gasped and put her hand on her mouth. While she stared downriver where the barge had disappeared, Preston briskly walked back the way he had come. She caught up with him and rode quietly alongside in the darkness.
Without slowing, he turned his head to face her and demanded, Why are you stalking me?
She sputtered for a moment in Dutch, and then tried again in English. I meant no harm. I was told you were a professional photographer and I wanted to see if I could learn from you.
They continued along the Kattendijk a bit, while she made an obvious struggle to find words. I was going to introduce myself when you got to Gouda but my cellphone died and I thought I had lost you. I rode around town a bit and almost gave up when I spotted you again coming out this way.
With a bit of stammering, she offered, Im sorry, Sir.
After a bit of tense silence, Preston asked, What does your cellphone have to do with it?
Please stop, Sir, and Ill show you, she begged.
He stopped and turned to face her. She pulled her bicycle almost behind him and reached out to his backpack. From someplace on the bag she pulled at something that made an audible click when it let go. She held out her hand to show him a tiny gadget no bigger than a zipper pull.
Its all the latest rage with wealthy families, she explained. The government has been experimenting with tracking stations around this area under a private contract  train stations, some shops, and popular hangouts. Parents can place this on anything their child is likely to carry and they wont notice. Every time the child passes a tracking point, it registers with a central website and parents can see in realtime where their child is going.
He stared hard at her for a moment. She added, There is a cellphone app that connects to the website and updates with onscreen alerts.
His face betrayed nothing. He breathed deeply, than asked mildly, So when did you tag me?
She seemed a bit relieved. The day you were lying on the ground in Katwijk. I was riding through there and saw you, and became fascinated. An old man standing nearby said you were yet another professional photographer using the old church as so many others do. Except, I could see you were getting a totally unique frame of the image. You left your bag where I could get to it and not disturb you.
She shifted on her bicycle seat, then spoke some more. I may lose my job and I was hoping youd be willing to apprentice me.

Chapter 3
Her name was Anja.
Preston reflected a moment. Thats rather like Angie in America.
Yes, she agreed. You can call me Angie; I like that. Angie it was.
By the time they arrived back in Gouda, he realized she had to be around thirty years old. Her story was pretty simple, in that she grew up in a Catholic orphanage somewhere close to the Delft and never knew her parents. She managed to graduate just about the time the orphanage closed and found various jobs with an inter-denominational Christian missionary society. She played whatever volunteer sports were available.
I was sexually abused along with all the other girls, but far less often because I was never as cute as the others. I was considered too boyish. She was also exposed to numerous different languages and spoke a few with enough fluency to pretend it was her native tongue. He noticed her English had a hint of proper British enunciation, but not too strong. As she continued chatting with him, it faded noticeably into a standard American sound.
The night air was still warm as they entered Gouda and made their way to the old market plaza. Preston pulled a small gadget from his pocket and was delighted to see several unsecured wifi signals were still available. The only lighting was the minimal security lamps here and there. He sat down in the shadows; Angie huddled next to him as he opened his laptop. He transferred the memory chip from the camera to the laptop and copied the video first.
After running through it couple of times, Preston zoomed in the middle frames of it to see the action with as much clarity as possible. He used editing software to bring the ambient light level up just a bit more. This he saved as a second video file. Then he copied out several frames showing the mans face as he walked back toward the wheelhouse after dumping the bag.
He explained to Angie, First, we take advantage of the face recognition software on a couple of major social websites. Sure enough, the site searching algorithms found a few matches, but only as a secondary person unnamed in the pictures.
So it means he has a social life of sorts, but avoids being identified the way most people do. Angie seemed rather surprised how easy it all was.
He turned to her and warned, This next part is rather risky. I have access to a commercial vendor site that happens to have a development contract with several national and international law enforcement agencies. One of my friends works there and lets me use his login. It checks images on file with the likes of Interpol and the FBI to see if theres a match. The problem is, if I get a hit, someone in those agencies is going to know about it. They might not have any idea who, simply because Im using a public wifi connection, but they are going to know where it was and when. I would go through Tor, but the site doesnt allow connections from there.
As he logged in, he added, Depending on what I find, Ill probably try to send a copy of the video to whichever agency seems most interested in him.
It took quite a while, but as long as the site seemed to be working and didnt come up empty, he waited. He was about to give up, though, when suddenly a black and white mugshot popped up on the screen. It was the same guy a good bit younger. All the data boxes below it were blank, except for the Interpol case number.
Why is there no data? Angie asked.
Prestons face went pale as the meaning dawned on him. He pressed the button combination for a screen grab, saved it to the camera chip and closed his laptop. He paused a moment and extracted the camera memory chip, stuffing it securely in his pants pocked. Then he thrust his laptop back into the knapsack. Jumping to his feet, he began walking immediately off toward the north. It took only a few moments for Angie to catch up on her bicycle. He cautioned her to silence with his finger and very nearly jogged along the narrow side streets. In the shadow of some trees a couple hundred meters from the train station, he stopped long enough to explain in a loud whisper.
Our boy was arrested at least once in the past; that was a mugshot. However, something on the level of a government agency covered for him. That would mean CIA, MI6 or perhaps Mossad. What we witnessed was not likely a common criminal act, but some kind of espionage. While I dont specifically know what they can do, nor how quickly, it is guaranteed to be very unpleasant if they ever find out about us and what we know.
He paused a moment while she absorbed that. Then he went on, As quickly as I can I am going to disappear. Im going to get as far from here as I can, and I suggest you do the same. Pretend you were never here, that you never met me. And for Gods sake, make sure there arent any more tags following us around. Pull the battery from your cellphone. Go somewhere safe and wait at least 24 hours before turning it back on.
She remembered the little tag and tossed it into bushes.
He turned to go in the direction of the open train platform. There were night trains at odd intervals in this part of the country. She caught up with him again. Keeping her voice in the same loud whisper he used, she pleaded with him. Take me with you! I know this area better than you; I know places to hide.
He barely turned his head as he walked a blistering pace along a narrow street. Are you ready to give up your whole life and marry me? Can you team up with me as if the only thing that matters is whatever crazy shit I think sounds like fun tonight or tomorrow? Are you ready to watch me die under torture and not say anything? Because I assure you right now, Im not all that interested in living a long and healthy life of peace and security. Im a complete madman. I have a mission in life and this business just threw me a curve ball. Im going to face it but I have no illusion about saving the world. Ill stumble along trying to estimate what makes the most sense according to what I believe.
He paused and caught his breath. I dont much care for all the things most people struggle to get from this world. Are you ready to sign onto that mission, sight unseen?
He barely closed his lips before she said, Yes! Of course I am. Do you think its been a nice life for me up to now? Until an hour ago I had no idea, but this is exactly what Ive been training for my whole life. If I get killed chasing you around the world, that would be a lot more meaningful than what Ive been doing so far.
He grinned and turned to face her. Youre my kind of gal. You may regret this just a few hours from now, but Im willing to let you come along if you can keep up.
With that, he pushed off in a renewed attack on the distance to the train platform.

Chapter 4
Where could they go?
One of the few night trains slowed, and then stopped just a few minutes after they climbed the platform. The cars were nearly empty. Yet because of the bicycle, they took jump seats on the foyer where two train cars were joined together. They readied their rail passes but the conductor never came. That happened often enough not to worry them.
Preston really wanted to gather a few personal items from where he was staying, but decided not to risk it. Angie seemed totally unconcerned about any property she might have accumulated anywhere. She convinced Preston they could rest for at least a few hours. By then they could come up with a better plan. They switched trains a couple of times, then she signaled it was time to get off when the train stopped in a quiet neighborhood. He must have dozed because he had no idea where they were. She led him off and along some very quiet broad streets, until he realized they were headed toward Duinrell again.
They bypassed the park and eventually ended up out in the wooded dunes area. It was obvious she knew exactly where to go, turning down trails he hardly saw in the darkness. She dismounted her bicycle and turned up a draw between two large dunes. Just beyond the saddle there was a rather flat spot obviously well used for camping. She walked across this and up the far side of the bowl. A few meters farther was a blind of trees where she simply plowed through the underbrush. On the other side was a tiny open space in the trees, which had suffered little from human traffic recently. She leaned her bike against the trees and walked to a sandy hump on one side. Digging in with her hands, she pulled out a plastic trash bag. She opened the collar holding it closed and pulled out a neatly folded tarp. She spread this on the ground and invited Preston to lay down on it and roll himself up on the edge.
He scarcely remembered anything until he realized the sun was well up in the eastern sky. Thats when he discovered Angies red curls were on his shoulder, his arm wrapped around her. She was on her side with her free arm laying across his stomach.
Well, aint this cozy, he murmured. She stirred to life. Looking up into his eyes, she planted a quick kiss on his cheek, and then rolled away and began putting her shoes on. He realized his were off, and began poking around for them. They were under his backpack, somewhere down at his feet. As he began to put them on, he was about to say something else but she spoke up.
I know who can help us, she said with all the assurance she could muster. She went on in a quieter tone. We had a man volunteer to teach for the Catholic school where I worked a few years ago. He had retired from some Foreign Service job. The students used to joke he was a Russian spy, but he seemed to know an awful lot about the various clandestine services of different countries.
She pulled up the tarp and Preston helped her shake off the sand and fold it back neatly. As she took the last fold from him and he help open the bag, she added one more thought. He said in the most solemn way possible that if I ever really needed help with something too big for me to handle, I should contact him. The school is not that far from here.
Can we talk about breakfast on the way? I still have my American appetite for a farmers breakfast and all this activity is making me even hungrier than normal. Preston was still pretty stiff but starting to warm up the joints with a little stretching.
Well, Den Haag Centraal has several real restaurants nearby, she offered. Thats on the way to the school. Still dragging her bicycle, she led him to a small station where they boarded. It was a short ride with several stops, but the central station in The Hague was massive. Angie made a quick phone call from one of the public phones at the station, and then came out with a smile. He chose Grannys Cafe because it was close and had food already waiting. Once full, he was ready to sleep again, but knew his aching joints would get no rest today.
Angie paused a moment, and then locked her bicycle in the caged storage area near most train stations. She tied a brightly colored piece of cloth on the front wheel and mumbled something in Dutch about someone else coming to find it. They boarded a bus heading south. Preston couldnt keep track of the municipal names as the bus wound its way along. Angie woke him a bit later and almost dragged him off the bus. He stumbled along beside her as they walked a few blocks and turned in at a metal gate. It was an older building, but for the time being, clearly used as a school. She led Preston up some steps, through ancient double doors and halfway down a long corridor to an open doorway.
She left him standing in the hallway waiting while she went through the social rituals of greeting, chatting a bit, then asking about something. The receptionist consulted a paper chart in front of her, and then gave a quick answer of two short sentences. There was more socializing and she handed the receptionist her bicycle key. The woman paused a bit, then said okay and took the key. Returning to him in the hallway, she led him down the hall farther and then up some stairs to the floor above. About three doors down she paused and looked through a tiny window in the door into a darkened room with flickering lights. Preston gathered it was a video presentation. Someone inside must have seen her, because Angie simply stepped back and waited.
An older fellow, obviously a sophisticated gentlemen, opened the door just a few inches and whispered something to her. There was some quick back and forth even Preston couldnt hear. He handed her a door key, smiled and turned back into the room, closing the door softly behind him. Angie grabbed his hand and dragged him back down the stairs and down two floors to the basement. It was much quieter here, none of the background hubbub typical of schools. On the left side were two swinging doors, followed by three sets of double doors, all closed. Preston guessed that was the kitchen and dining area. On the other side of the hall were two storerooms and a large wooden door. Using the key, Angie opened this, glanced inside, and then pulled Preston behind her before closing the door. He surmised it was the teachers lounge.
He sighed, took one of the more heavily padded chairs along one wall. Angie sat next to him and took his hand. He was almost asleep when the old gentleman joined them. The man spoke in precise British English, Dont get up, at least not yet. Apparently he had more than one key, but Angie handed back to him the one she had. He accepted it without a word, and then turned to Preston.
They shook hands; My name is Hendrik Venkman.

Chapter 5
Could I persuade you to come back up to my classroom? Its vacant now and Id feel much more comfortable discussing things there than I would here.
Preston smiled while his muscles whimpered. Once inside the classroom, still relatively dark, the man closed and locked the door. Preston realized there was no light shining under the door from the sunlit hallway.
Mr. Venkman asked, What have we got, Preston?
Preston slipped his laptop from the backpack and placed it on the large desk there. Opening the lid, he brought the system to life. Digging into his pocket, he produced the camera chip and inserted it into the slot. As expected, Mr. Venkman wanted to see his altered version twice, then the raw version. He also asked to see the screen capture followed by the composite Preston had made from the video.
He shook his head and smiled. Preston, you and Anja are in serious trouble. He took a step back and held up his right hand in a gesture meant to forestall arguments. Dont get me wrong. Im really very glad you two chose to bring this to me first, regardless of your reasons, and so soon after the fact. But Im sure you realize none of this is can be made simple.
Preston had heard this lecture before, in different terms. Mr. Venkman, I decided long ago there were no real good guys, no right or wrong sides, just some which can hinder or help what I consider most important. I admit I know precious little of these things, but I do know what my conscience demands.
The old man smiled broadly. We are all bad guys to somebody. Even under the same government there are competing agencies and genuine bloodshed between them. I wont bother to explain my position. It wont mean anything to you and certainly wont help you any. However, I do hope to keep you and Anja alive and able to pursue your personal quests in life.
He crossed his left arm over his chest and grabbed the right elbow. His right hand held his chin for a moment, and then he gestured slightly at the face on the screen. Our man is Israeli, but not Mossad; some other agency that does some of the same work. Ill thank you for a copy of that raw video with the GPS data, because we can get someone out there today to find the body. That should prove quite interesting. Meanwhile, you need to disappear for awhile, because in order to use this evidence at all, a copy will eventually make its way to this mans friends.
He folded his hands, raising his index fingers together to his nose for a moment. Then he dropped his hands and gestured to the two of them. For the next few days, probably weeks, you must not allow anyone or anything to separate you two physically. Sleep together, shower together, and even go to the toilet together. Pretend you are handcuffed. I cannot emphasize that enough.
He walked around his desk, reached into a side drawer and handed Preston a jump drive, brand new in the package. Copy those files onto this. While Preston busied himself with that, Mr. Venkman went on. I suggest you remove your excess hair, Preston. Shave your head and most of your beard. Preston glanced up with a grin, then at Angie. Mr. Venkman didnt notice but was digging in another drawer. He produced a packet of blank index cards. Pulling one out, he replaced the pack. Then he pushed some papers aside exposing a glass sheet atop the wooden surface. With the other hand he reached inside his desk and pulled out a sharp lead pencil.
As he put his laptop away, Preston noticed the man printed carefully in all caps, barely pressing down with the pencil so as to leave the faintest writing. He passed it to Angie. Go to the address at the top there; be very careful about that. Show them this card and speak in your best German, asking for a tour of the apple cider plant. Within in an hour from that, you should be safer than youve been since shooting this video. Youll go on a nice honeymoon and forget the rest of the world for awhile.
Someone knocked on the door. Forget nothing Ive said, Mr. Venkman said with all seriousness, and then smiled and acted like they had been discussing old times. He moved toward the door while shaking their hands using both of his in a warm clasp. He started speaking in Dutch, basically thanking them for coming and wishing them well.
Outside on the street again, they stopped at a drug store and Preston grabbed a razor, hair scissors and some baby oil, among other things. He asked, Where to next?
Rotterdam, she answered with a far away look in her eyes.
Preston thought it was almost fun having Angie jammed in the tiny train toilet with him. He sat on the toilet and slid back against the wall, taking his shirt off. She was quite helpful though, clipping him clean with the scissors and making sure the hair fell onto the tracks through the opening of the toilet between his knees. Then she wet the remaining stubble from a water bottle before he applied the baby oil and began shaving his face. The cheap razor just barely managed to keep a cutting edge until his head was smooth.
They cleaned up the mess, and then he showed her his passport while he struggled back into his shirt. So thats what you were laughing about, she said. He now looked like his old passport photo, having grown all that hair and whiskers during the test voyage on Harrys sloop.
She hugged and kissed him before they exited the confined space. I like this look, she affirmed.

Chapter 6
They were looking for one of the many tourist information kiosks.
It was a short walk south from the Rotterdam central station. Among the many large buildings with odd shapes, they found the street. They did their best to keep track of the numbers. At one point she was sure they had found it, but it was a freestanding kiosk too far off the street in an open plaza. Preston stood staring into the glass front of a convention center. He pointed; Is that it?
There was a booth inside the lobby of the building. She doubled checked the address, and then decided he was correct. This one had the same collection of pamphlets, maps, souvenirs, and transportation tickets as any other, but displayed differently. Preston decided this one included a wider array of languages than what usually festooned the ones at tourist traps. He stood back a bit and let Angie handle it.
Konnten wir die Apfelwein-Anlage? She held out the card that Mr. Venkman had given her.
The woman behind the counter took the card and glanced at it. Without the slightest hint of a smile she dropped it somewhere behind her counter and pulled out a garish pamphlet with cartoon apples and jugs on the front. It was all in German, but she opened it and began a memorized spiel in German while her finger tapped a spot in one corner. Preston drew forward close enough to see that it was a single paragraph in tiny clear English text.
Angie looked up with a smile, took the pamphlet and turned to walk away. Part of Preston was thinking that this was getting pretty melodramatic. He started laughing and it was infectious; Angie chuckled but was not exactly sure what caused the hilarity. They were supposed to find a hostel called The Room down close to the water as their next landmark. The small typeface English paragraph in the pamphlet said they should walk down to the river quay directly nearest the hostel and someone would meet them. This made Preston just a little nervous, given how this whole mess started on a river barge.
They never got there. It seemed some portion of Rotterdam was always under renovation, with scaffolding and usually shrouds hanging from it. In sight of the hostel, they were forced to walk inside one of the half-darkened curtained sidewalks where noisy work was taking place above them. A workman suddenly stepped out and, with a very big smile, guided them inside the work area. He pointed to two folks dressed somewhat the same as they, who turned and walked off where they had been headed. The man placed hard plastic safety helmets on their heads and allowed them to watch from behind a billowing sheet of plastic. The couple walked all the way down to the nearest quay, stepped into a water taxi and rode off across the river.
Then the man guided them through a maze of temporary walls and curtains accompanied by the noise of various power tools along with the shouts of workers. No one seemed to pay them any attention at all. They approached a work van backed up under one of the tarps. The man opened one of the back doors and beckoned them inside, taking their safety helmets. It was loaded with rolls of carpet and thin foam padding, so they clambered on top. Preston couldnt resist lying down lengthwise on a fat roll of padding and found it surprisingly comfortable. Angie arranged herself along a roll next to him. They couldnt see who got into the front seat and started the motor, but decided it was too late to worry about such things any more.
Preston awoke to see Angie leaning back with her rump down between two of the large diameter rolls. He checked his watch; two hours so far and truck kept zooming along at highway speeds. It was a noisy ride, but they were able to talk by putting their faces close together.
She asked, Why do you suppose he was so adamant about us remaining physically close?
Preston didnt hesitate. Trust. Anyone trying to hurt us would naturally try to use one of us against the other. So long as we are together, we can watch each other and our trust grows. Theres no such thing as absolute trust, because we cant even trust our selves, in one sense. But once we confide in each other, we become responsible for each other until its over with.
What did you mean by having a mission in this life?
He placed one hand over his mouth and rubbed the shortened beard a moment. Its not something secret, but Im not sure I can explain it. Its simply ... I feel like God has enlisted me in something I dont exactly understand, only that I have to be ready for just about anything. I dont doubt He knows, and I sense Im always working near angels who know, but Im doing good just to keep up.
He paused a moment, and then continued. If you believe in God and angels, there are some things you just take on faith. You have to listen to something stronger and yet quieter than mere intellect. Something in the circumstances told me to trust you, and it appears you trusted me already.
Angie nodded affirmatively, her eyes bright with attention.
You cant always test and analyze things. You cant always trust the results when you do analyze. You have to learn to choose some things on factors beyond the conscious mind. For every demon there are two angels; when you run toward a clear conscience, things tend to work out in the long run. For now, at least, you and I can trust each other far more than anyone else in this world.
She took his hand. Did you mean it literally when you asked if I wanted to marry you?
He explained he didnt care about government or church permits, but at that moment he had been ready to make a genuine offer of lifetime commitment, and hadnt changed his mind. If anything, he was even more sure it was a good idea.
I think so, too, she said with a smile. He responded by half rolling over and kissing her lips until she nearly melted.

Chapter 7
It was a honeymoon, indeed.
The truck stopped and a moment later, the driver opened the back door, hiding himself behind it. Clambering out, they stood and gazed around the walled courtyard of a very old rural manor. His voice behind the door said, Rode deur. They walked toward the only red door visible in the place. The van hurried out the gate. Turning the long handle, Preston opened it and looked inside. To his eyes it appeared as a nice little townhouse apartment, fully furnished. He turned and found Angie waiting, so he scooped her up in his arms and carried her inside. It was the first time he heard her actually giggling like a girl. It was a good sign.
Preston set her back on her feet and wandered to the back window. The joke was on them. He saw endless rows of apple trees. Off to one side was a large building with what he was sure were large vats, fat plumbing and conveyor belts. Apple cider mill, he said out loud. She chuckled.
They eventually met their hosts. The old man was taciturn and they seldom saw him. His wife was quite the social butterfly. She gave them their security briefing, sounding very much like some of the government bureaucrats Preston had encountered in the military, just with a much nicer tone of voice and choice of words. Her English was pure American Midwest.
They shouldnt leave until further notice, but that meant they had the run of the place as long as they didnt get in the old mans way. Preston wasnt in a hurry to explore. The old lady had some assistant measure them and fetch in local clothing of reasonable quality the next day. They hadnt been in any particular hurry to get dressed the next morning, but found the clothing laid across the two armchairs downstairs.
For the next couple of days they strolled around the property and simply got to know each other. Both had seen so much trouble that there were no significant conflicts or implacable demands. They were still getting over the shock of their good and bad fortune, deciding it was definitely worth it in the balance of things. Still, the sudden and dramatic changes were mind numbing at first.
At some point, they really needed to let their real world friends know they were okay. Angie had been living in part of the old nuns quarters at the school where she served as a teachers aid. In a quick phone call, she simply told the sister in charge that she had been falsely arrested in an overzealous police sweep during a riot. This was the protest and demonstration season in The Hague. Angie said it would take some time to process her case but she already knew how it would turn out.
Preston had a much trickier problem. Harry would worry but only if Preston never got back to him. However, Harry was notoriously bad about answering any of his phones and Preston didnt trust anyone else to get him a message. Since Harry was an avid reader of the nautical forums, Preston decided that was the best way to contact him. Once he explained what he planned to do to avoid Harry calling the police or anything, their hostess gave him access to a wired broadband connection. He had never used the ethernet adapter so his MAC address would be unknown on the Net. He immediately connected with Tor and posted a pre-written message where Harry would surely see it:
Been kidnapped by a foxy redhead and have no idea where I am. If I cant escape Ill whisper for help next month.
It was true enough and Harry was quite likely to buy it, not to mention have a good laugh.
After a few days Preston had an itch for some photo work. He brought his camera to the breakfast table. Angie looked at him with a faint smile and a raised eyebrow. Time for your training, apprentice, he announced.
Preston estimated they were on a high ridge because the wind was more constant and the temperatures marginally cooler than what he expected. They hadnt crossed any borders because he could see Dutch traffic signs on roads running near the property so there werent that many places they could be driven in less than three hours and still be in the Netherlands.
They wandered the property at length as he taught her to think like a photographer. The lens hardly replaces the eye. They are symbiotic. The lens catches things the eyes cannot see, but it requires the eye to give meaning to any resulting image. Thus, all the details my eyes could not see in that video from the night we met.
Angie responded, And all the meaning which gave us so much trouble, but also gave us each other.
He grinned. I have no doubt you would have carried through your plot to attach yourself to me one way or another. And I surely would have fallen for you sooner or later. This just hurried things along by stripping our existence down to the bare essentials.
There were more than just apple trees on the place. The Dutch government keeps a tight regulation over old growth forest, which stands in odd patches all over the country. Preston spotted a very substantial old tree on a faint elevation in the ground. The bark showed signs of wear from previous climbers. Ah, he said holding one finger in the air, time for an elevated viewing angle. Angie was a more energetic climber than he, but his reach was much longer. He managed to get up into the higher branches before he felt the tree waving too much under his weight.
The problem with trees, he said panting, is there arent many open angles through the foliage. He was turning as best he could without losing his grip. Something caught his eye to the north. With great care and shifting around a bit, he caught a glimpse of a white cross atop a round structure. While describing what he saw, he took out his camera. Zooming in the viewer, he saw something move, and then dropping down from the tower at an angle. He watched a little longer and saw it again. He held the camera overhead in a blind estimate and took a short video, panning slowly and as steadily as possible.
He was reminded that coming down was harder than climbing up if you wanted to avoid getting hurt. It gets harder when a man passes forty. At the bottom, they huddled over the back of the camera watching the viewer. They decided it was a spire or tower, but with an open top. After zooming in, Preston recognized the movement he saw earlier. Slide for life, he said. People were dropping out of the tower harnessed to a cable.
More importantly, he saw a high hilly background behind and it clicked. We are in South Limburg, the only part of the Netherlands with any kind of hills. A tall spire with a white cross is common to just about any part of Europe, but one used for recreation like that could only be the Wilhelmina Tower, dont you think?
She grinned. Valkenburg!

Chapter 8
They did an awful lot of experimental shooting around the place.
To Angie, the camera looked like a fat smart phone. The lens was better than what one found on cellphones, and would telescope outward for most shooting. It shares much of the same technology with cellphones, Preston assured her. He pointed out that the only two external controls were a pair of buttons near opposing corners along one side. Both are double deep. This one, the first click turns it on or wakes it up from sleep mode. Once the camera is activated, it does nothing. Press farther to the second click and it takes a still shot. The other button allows you to view through the lens on the first click to compose your shots, or records the view as video on the second click. Everything else, including power-down, is on the touch screen controls. The entire back panel was a view screen.
The old man was a little nervous about them poking around the apple cider presses, but when Preston began discussing the various pieces of equipment and maintenance, he relaxed visibly. It was painfully obvious English was not all that easy for him, and he sometimes paused to think of the word for this or that piece of equipment. So while Angie practiced framing shots with high contrast and visually appealing angles, Preston learned about pressing and juicing apples, separating the solids and the fermentation process.
The man stepped away to do something or other while Preston discussed with Angie the results of her efforts. Suddenly, he stopped. One image indicated an anomaly his eyes had missed earlier. Among an array of pipes, one was not quite parallel with the others. He stepped around and took a look. His eyes chased the pipe back to see if this misalignment had any significance. He wasnt sure, but it looked like a joint was bent back behind one of the vats.
The old man seemed only mildly irritated when Preston interrupted his work to ask about it. Preston showed him the image on the camera viewer, and then pointed out what he saw. The old man looked back and forth between the two, and then became absorbed in walking around the vat in question, back and forth. He went and got a folding ladder from the corner of the building and came back, opening it out near the corner of the pipes. After a bit of shifting it around, he climbed slowly, carefully turning himself for the best view. A bit more shifting and then he froze, starring at the backside of the joint. He touched it with his fingers, rubbing back and forth gently.
He mumbled to himself in Dutch. Cracked, he announced in English.
Preston had not forgotten any of his mechanical knowledge, and the old man seemed genuinely grateful for Prestons help in replacing the joint. When they were through, the old man insisted on a careful inspection of all the rest, even asking Preston to take more pictures. Preston coached Angie through more shooting for the particular purpose of engineering analysis. They found nothing wrong, but a repeat of the earlier shot confirmed things were now neatly lined up.
From then on, the old man seemed to take a good deal more interest in their camera work around his property.
As they sat down to dinner that evening in their apartment, Preston said to Angie, Tell me about camping in the dunes.
She grinned and blushed just a bit. At the orphanage, our presiding priest was old and pretty tame. We loved him. Unfortunately, his bishop was younger and not a nice man at all. Whenever he came to visit, at least one or two students always got raped. The nuns were powerless and didnt seem to believe us, anyway. Three of us girls didnt like the risks, so we would hide. There were all kinds of places around the school seldom used. When we got old enough to have our own student rail passes, we would find some excuse, like going to one of the museums or a music recital somewhere, coming back as late as we dared. As we got older, we took greater risks. Once or twice we simply stayed out overnight, coming back and taking our punishment after the bishop left. In our wandering, we discovered that spot. We pooled our money for a tarp and camped out there because no one ever bothered us. Over the years, I replaced the tarp once or twice and used the place just to get away.
Preston thought for a moment. Can you picture this? While you were going through that, I was here with the US Army running all over the countryside, completely oblivious to such things.
The next day began the lessons on photo editing software.
They were interrupted when their hostess came by about mid-morning. She began by expressing gratitude for their help with the equipment. Regardless whatever else she and her husband were doing, they still had to make a living and fixing the cracked joint before the system pressured up and blew apple juice all over the building saved them all kinds of money. Apple season was not that far away.
It becomes necessary to explain a bit about your staying here and who we are. Naturally, you would expect me to avoid saying more than you really need to hear, she said.
Preston knew all too well from his days in the service. I learned to bridle my curiosity a long time ago. Its harnessed to much more important things.
She smiled. Yes, I see that. Youve been no problem at all for us. We simply told you not to leave because we cant help you much otherwise, but no one here will physically restrain you. Your measured curiosity has served us quite well up to now and we want to encourage your apparently wise choices.
Preston turned his head to one side as he looked at the older woman. How much would you be able to explain about this we that Angie and I have stumbled upon?
Her smile faded somewhat. Thats what I came to talk about this morning. Hendrik gave you a hint of the complexities and you appeared to accept, even if you didnt exactly understand. We are nothing like your military, nor anything you might have read about regarding the various clandestine services. We dont actually serve any particular government or the global banking system. Much more than that I shouldnt say. Perhaps I could characterize us as people involved in a lot of other things who have agreed together that, once in awhile, someone should do something sane and actually help common people who may never know. We dont pretend our goals are all that lofty because our decisions and our operations are more instinctive and philosophical than activist and political.
She waved her hand as if to dismiss a world of things. Its almost like a hobby; we all have to pay our own way. We fail more often than we succeed, if you measure things in terms of objectives. Yet, we agree we cannot stop trying to do some things. There is no real structure; we each volunteer for each project. People come and go in our association; its been active since World War II. So far, nothing has ever come back to haunt us in ways we find unbearable. It could come apart at any moment and we would all go on with our lives still trying to do what we find we must do.
Angie spoke up. It sounds like a homily from my favorite old priest. He said the only worthy goal in this life is peace with God at whatever cost in human terms. Even if you dont believe in God, its the optimal life to seek the place where the soul and conscience agree to rest.
The hostess smiled. Thats a more familiar way of saying the same thing. What holds our association together is not what we believe, but what we can agree on today as something we simply have to stop or well never be able to live with ourselves. Instead of activists loudly promoting some popular causes, we happen to have stumbled upon an affinity among certain people who have talents and an acquaintance with greater political power and what goes on behind the scenes. We recruit very carefully. Hendrik is not in a position to become your case officer, as it were, but my husband and I are. We think you two would make a marvelous addition, adding capabilities impossible to duplicate without a far higher cost.
Then she added, We cant hire you ourselves, but it so happens an associate of ours is hiring photographers for a legitimate publishing business.

Chapter 9
Prestons mind reeled, but some deeper part of him understood all too well that he would have to say yes.
His only question was Angie. As he turned to look at her, she blurted out, Met U al de weg, schatje. Nobody had to translate that for him: Im with you all the way, sweetheart.
Their hostess responded, Goed zo. We want you to continue the training by wandering the countryside here. Feel free to check out the tourist traps in Valkenburg, but Id like you to focus on being able to use that facial recognition stuff.
She rose to her feet and took a step toward them. Id also like to braid that lovely red hair, Angie. It will make it easier to hide under a hat. Preston looks nothing like the man who wandered the area around The Hague, but well get you both hats and sunglasses just the same. Theres no sense taking unnecessary risks with either of you being identified by anyone, regardless how harmless they may seem. Preston, do your best to stay in character as a Dutchman.
Their adventurous natures chafed at skipping the most exciting attractions as they wandered Valkenburg each morning. It was more important to take pictures of other people doing those things, all kinds of things, and then spending the afternoons testing their skills at matching faces with various social websites. Angie picked up on it quickly.
Preston got up the make them tea. As he was brining the cups to the table, she had a clearly puzzled look on her face. Before he even sat down, she said, The software has keyed on someone off to one side here. We have him in two frames but why does he get a blue square? I thought it framed our subjects in red.
Preston froze for a moment. Thats a different function. Its someone weve tracked before but never identified. He pulled the laptop closer and began mousing and typing. His heart stopped when it pulled up the image that had gotten them into so much trouble. It was the face of the Israeli spy.
Preston had never seen his hosts so busy once he showed them their unexpected discovery. No one had to tell them to stay inside their apartment for awhile. They had not asked, and had no way to guess how many of the orchard employees here were in on the hobby, but two or three different ones popped in once or twice for confirmation of something. Twice they were asked for various enhancements of this or that image, having passed the entire collection to their hosts as soon as they made the discovery.
It was late that evening, and who could sleep? They tried to compare notes and make as much sense as possible without bothering anyone else. There was a gentle knock on the door, but it still startled them, since no one had come by in the past few hours.
Their hostess came in all business, yet somehow elegantly relaxed. Our boy isnt alone, but we are sincerely puzzled why they would send him when he was already IDd. Weve decided it cant be a matter of bait trying to flush us out. The trail for them must have gone cold in town, but we can only surmise hes been promoted from basic thug to some kind of supervisory role, at least for their current operation. It may even be a form of discipline to make him clean up his own mess.
Preston wondered out loud, We were hardly the only people using a camera in a tourist trap like Valkenburg. At the same time, anyone who knows photography can spot another photographer in a crowd of yokels with cameras. Real photographers take a lot more time and far fewer candid snapshots, but shoot a lot more frames of the same subject from only slightly different positions.
Their hostess shook her head sagely. No doubt they were shooting both still and video cameras trying to pick out that very thing.
Angie remarked she had noticed another couple had been doing something similar at two or three places in town over the past three days.
The hostess paused for a moment. Do you like camping?
Angie and Preston looked at each other with faint grins, almost synchronized in saying, Of course we do.
The older lady smiled. Im sure we can find some equipment around her you might find useful for exploring. My husband and I tried it, but we are just too old for that sort of thing. Still, we kept the gear.
Stepping slowly toward the door, their hostess went on. The two things any self-respecting Dutch village has in these parts are a bakery and a bicycle shop. Its a short drive to Margraten, which is just such a village. I want you to buy good mountain bikes to fit your bodies. Pack your bags before you go; well have someone drive you down and park off a ways. Once you have the bikes, grab you bags and take a tour of the Ardennes. Youll love the scenery in the Belgian hedge lands and the high moors. I recommend you ride through Banholt, then stick to the small paths over the border to someplace like Sint Martens. You should know how to recognize the GR markers, but well get you a map just in case. From there, use your imagination, but stay well east of the Maas Valley. We dont have any friends in that area right now.

Chapter 10
It should have been an ideal way to avoid trouble, but it was not to be.
The morning dawned with heavy cloud cover and a hint of mist, but the weather was the least of their problems. The SUV was outside their door, but when they came out with their backpacks, the found the driver crouched by the right rear tire, cursing softly in Dutch.
Almost to himself, he said out loud in heavily accented English, I really should have had that flat fixed last week but this is the spare, and now its flat, too. He walked off to the garage. Returning a few minutes later he had a can of foam flat fixer.
This stuff is really messy but it cant be helped. Ill get it all fixed after you two get on your way. He connected the nozzle and began filling the tire with the foam and compressed air. After a few minutes it was up enough to drive safely. The driver tossed the can in the floor behind his seat.
Preston had Angie take shotgun while he sat behind her. The driver told them to make sure they put on their hats, but that wearing sunglasses would be out of place. Im just a friend taking you to get new bikes for your honeymoon.
He drove past the bike shop on the main street through town, pointing at it with his hand below the window level, and then circled around on the streets behind it. He pulled into a tiny brick surfaced parking lot in front of some shops. They got out and walked down around the corner back to the bicycle vendor with currency the driver handed them when he shut the motor off.
At the shop in Margraten, Preston found a dandy bike on sale, but they had nothing other than the standard single-speed commuter model to fit Angie. There was no way she could keep up on that. He rode slowly while she walked alongside back to the little parking lot, joking about the reversal of roles. The driver suggested they drive on to Banholt where there was another small bike shop. With Prestons bike strapped down on the roof, off they went.
The driver followed N278 for a ways, then slowed. As they waited to turn left off the main drag, something nibbled at the edge of Angies mind. She turned her head and saw a vaguely familiar face on a bicycle waiting in the bicycle path for them to turn in front of her. She had the right of way, but sat with one foot on the ground, waiting. As they headed down the narrow lane south, she turned to say something to Preston but was interrupted by an odd clicking sound coming from the right rear wheel.
The driver slowed, glancing in the outside mirror. Dont tell me its already gone flat again... Then his eyes bulged and he gunned to motor, racing down the narrow lane.
While keeping his eyes forward, he turned just a bit toward Angie. Theres a dart or something sticking in the tire. Apparently the foam prevented it from losing pressure right away but it means they are right behind us somewhere.
After whizzing across open fields about a kilometer, the road curved right and followed a tree line on the left. Suddenly it made a sharp left into the trees and downslope. Almost immediately the driver swung back to the right up a very narrow farm road. Get ready to bail out. Take the path to the left behind the trees while I lead them off. Youre on your own. He handed Angie a wad of currency, then slammed on the brakes. Now!
On a whim, Preston leaned over and grabbed the half-used can of flat fixing foam from the floor. He slid out of the seat while the SUV slowed to a walking pace. Grabbing Angies hand, he broke into a run, leading her around behind the vehicle. As the driver gunned the engine and flew off up the main path toward the Margraten Cemetery, they sprinted down the dirt track, screened from the road by trees. A few meters down they turned into the trees and crouched in the underbrush. A car came blitzing along a few seconds later behind the SUV.
They waited a long time, unsure what to do. The terrain was a bit hilly with lots of trees and shrubs. Like most places in the Netherlands, the paths were sunk well below the level of the fields. It seemed a good bet they could probably avoid being seen, but it was critical they get moving and keep moving. He pulled out the map, and then shrugged into his backpack.
Angie gave a brave smile and said, Adventure!
He studied the map as they hustled down the sandy path. He didnt like how their current path was bending back straight west. It was a popular bike route to Maastricht and the wrong direction. He would have cut across the fields on the left and grabbed another path back west and south, but the narrow lane was blocked by a large wagon moving very slowly, pulled by some vehicle obscured on the other side of it.
This meant moving along a paved farm road just a few meters before diving back into the countryside. They both were watching as they approached the road, hesitating just a moment, and then running along the road. They never made it to the second path.
Coming at them from the south was the car they had seen shortly before chasing the SUV. They dodge up against the fence as the car slowed, and then swerved and nearly hit them. It halted, the right side tire sliding in the grass. The person in the passenger seat had the window rolled down, grinning broadly at them.
Their Israeli spy was a pretty large fellow.
Before he could think, Preston aimed the can of foam and covered the large face. The man bellowed in pain, slapping his hands into the yellow goo. Preston crouched just a bit and aimed at the driver, who turned out to be a woman. Her eyes went wide, then she stomped the accelerator and nearly took Prestons arm off as she pulled away.
She promptly drove the little car up under the front axle of a very large farm tractor that had just entered the road from the left side. It came off a downward sloping path screened tightly on both sides by trees. The operator was dodging tree limbs as he turned out onto the road and hadnt seen the car.
Preston was hoping the tractor driver hadnt seen him and Angie either, as they fled up their intended path. Glancing back, he doubted either of the occupants could possibly get out of the car any time soon, even if they were alive.

Chapter 11
Preston set a blistering pace but Angie managed to keep.
At one point it seemed he was unsure of the route, because he turned toward the west again. At the next trail junction he stopped, yanked the camera out of the cargo pocket on his hiking shorts and fiddled with it a bit. Angie was too much out of breath to ask what he was doing. Almost as suddenly he stuffed it back into the pocket and turned, nearly doubling back the way they had come.
The Dutch-Belgian border in that area generally follows the lip of highlands. Prestons breakneck pace continued down the steep slope, but in Sint Martens he finally slowed down. They stopped at a friture for dinner. Preston pulled out a sturdy plastic fork. I hate those little picks they give you with fries.
They passed under the arched viaduct bearing the rail line through the village, and then decided against camping. After checking to find several hostels and hotels full, they found one opening. The map had indicated it was a bed and breakfast and the price for staying was cheap enough.
Preston sat down on the side of the bed. Slowly he reached into his cargo pocket again. He pulled out the camera and held it up as if it were evidence of a crime. Angie asked, Did we break it?
He sighed. If we had it might have prevented some of our excitement today. He woke it from sleep mode and began stroking the screen menus. After thinking about it on our meandering way here today, I finally realized why they found us so easily after all we went through to avoid them. I was thinking about how you followed me for several weeks.
On the screen was a submenu for GPS settings. One of the items said, Tracking. He tapped with his finger to show it could be changed to Active mode. He tapped it again and changed it back to Passive mode.
Preston explained, It was set by default to active mode and I changed it when we stopped back up on the ridge. Its supposed to be an anti-theft feature. On cheaper cameras like this, there arent many options for controlling how it works.
He took a deep breath. I said it shared a lot of technology with cellphones. This one reports a unique identifying code to any cell tower. Most carriers ignore it until you report it stolen and pay a small fee to activate the tracking. Then they report the location to the local police as stolen property. The range is nothing like regular cellphones, so while we were at the orchard, it probably didnt reach any towers consistently. When we climbed that tree, it probably sent one blip to the cell tower at Valkenburg because it was in line of sight. The next nearest tower I saw was near Margraten, so I doubt our hosts were compromised because of the lack of triangulation. Our boy was Israeli, and Israeli companies have a near monopoly on the technology that runs most telephone carriers. Their software often has backdoors, too. They wouldnt even have to pay a fee to identify what towers reported the cameras location, but thin coverage out here made it tough on them.
He lay back on the bed. However, for the price of a decent meal at any gasthaus, you can purchase a scanner that picks up the same reporting signal. All someone has to do is match the unique ID this thing transmits with the data that was imprinted in every frame of that video I gave Mr. Venkman. He was being a little subtle when he warned me about the GPS and it falling into their hands.
Angie gasped, putting her hand over her mouth.
Then they both burst out laughing helplessly, and she collapsed on the bed beside him.
The next morning Preston got out his laptop. Since he ran Linux on it, he showed Angie how to use the basic features, and then he had her watch him change the MAC address on the wifi. We may need to do this pretty regularly. I also need to pick up a couple of different types of USB wifi adapters to switch out now and then. For the time being, well be very careful and do this one thing. And maybe we can talk our sponsors into getting us a better camera.
Their hosts had given them an account on a service Preston had not heard about before. It amounted to a dropbox for encrypted files. It was an FTP folder; at random intervals the files stored there came and went, or were simply renamed. The time stamps were constantly changed. They were all encrypted, but what mattered was the key used. Preston wrote up a brief report of what they had experienced, encrypted with the key that their hosts had given them physically. He had struggled to memorize the long passphrase, but eventually got it. Angie had it almost immediately. All they knew about the service was that someone checked the contents of the folder frequently and would find his message. If he was expecting a message, he simply grabbed the contents of the folder, entered the passphrase into a script they gave him and it checked them all. When the script closed, it deleted all the files. This time there was nothing, so they decided to continue their exploration of the Ardennes.
A couple of days later they were in a campground in the German-speaking part of Eupen, preparing to enter the high moors and visit the lake east of the city. Preston found he could get a clear wifi signal if he crossed the little stream and climbed part way up the wooded hillside. He and Angie sat in a small clearing just off the trail. When he checked the FTP account, this time his script spat out a decrypted message.
No survivors. Tracking device in the car confirms your suspicions. We can get you a better camera later. For now, vacation is over. Train to Raeren; hike over the border into Roetgen for bikes. Speak English; call yourselves Daphne and Edward Forttensie. More later.
There was an address at the bottom for a bike shop. He placed the computer in her lap. Memorize that, Miss Perfect Memory.
She grinned. I suppose you arent Daphne, she suggested, patting his knee. They both chuckled.
When she handed it back to him, he said, Babe, are you ready to give our riding legs and guardian angels another workout?
She kissed him. With a big grin, she affirmed, Im with you all the way, schatje.

Part 2  Of Wheels and Angels

Chapter 12
Belgian Rail sucks.
Preston gazed upward through the clear plastic roof over the bench where they sat. The light mist was collecting and dripping off the edges. Several people stood on the long platform with umbrellas and various other means of shedding the cool morning damp.
They had come early because they had no idea of the schedule. But apparently the schedule didnt matter that much today, because the train was late. At least by coming early they got one of the few seats on the covered benches. Yet there was little competition for them, as they shared their bench with only one older man who chuckled at Prestons comment.
Angie and Preston sat with their packs on the ground beside their feet. He considered himself quite fortunate their hosts had such nice camping equipment to loan them. It was all very light and easy to use, and the packs were quite comfortable.
Angie hummed some tune Preston didnt recognize, but it didnt matter. She had fine voice and it was soothing to hear. He reached up from behind and stroked her neck under the braided red hair. She tilted her head back just a bit and smiled, eyes closed. Yes, it was worth it all he reminded himself for the hundredth time in  had it only been ten days? The summer was still ahead of them and it appeared his dream marriage was matched with a dream job that suited them both. Even if it all came apart, having been here for just awhile was better than he deserved.
She leaned back and snuggled against him, but only for a few seconds as the sound and vibration in the ground signaled the approach of the train. Suffering the quirky service of the Belgian rail system was a small price to pay for things.
It wasnt a long ride from Eupen to Raeren, just a few kilometers. As they stepped off the train, they noticed parts of the station appeared rather dilapidated, while other parts were quite new. Preston studied the map for a minute. On the far side of the rails was a narrow strip of asphalt. Looking back up the track, he pointed to the left side of the rails. Thats supposed to be a part of the Venn Bahn, a decommissioned cargo line now used for recreation. Nice and flat but if we took it now, that would be about three or four times the distance.
After looking at the map and glancing around, they decided cutting across country would risk getting them lost on some of the poorly marked trails and delaying them. Leaving the station, they stopped to consult the map posted in a large, freestanding display case beside the street. The main road to Roetgen was a fairly simple route wandering out the southeast corner of the village and it turned out to be well marked. But once outside the municipal boundary, the generous paved walking and biking path disappeared where the woods began.
The clouds drifted apart, allowing the sun to peek through in places. Damp surfaces glistened in the dappled sunlight. They shed their rain parkas. Walking from behind, it dawned on Preston that he had never seen Angie wear anything close fitting. She did have a feminine shape, but was nonetheless a bit stocky for her height.
For a while it was a simple matter to avoid the vehicular traffic by walking just off the road in the trees, but eventually the thick underbrush drove them back onto the narrow crumbling pavement. This was about the same time the other hikers pretty much disappeared, and they were alone with the sparse vehicular traffic.
When possible, they walked holding hands. You are a heart of sweetness coated in delicious milk chocolate. Why do I get the feeling you havent had a long string of lovers before me? Her blushing grin was worth the time it took to think that one up, Preston decided.
She thought for a moment. Most men Ive met arent half so interesting as you.
Good answer, Babe. I get along well with Dutch men, and they can be quite adventurous, but there is definitely something missing in most of them. Fellows like my friend Harry are quite unusual. But most Dutch women are, in many ways, the same. American women can be quite materialistic too, but its a different flavor of materialism. Your lack of it makes you a rare treat.
Maybe I spent too much time hanging around nuns. They are like that.
Preston kicked at a fragment of broken asphalt in the road. For some reason you never felt the call to be one of them, he surmised.
Her face took on a more serious aspect. The Catholic Church has always been a good place to find spiritual warmth and commitment, but the institution itself is... she paused, looking for the word. I think its broken, misguided. Its like good things happen despite the system and some of the people.
Preston pursed his lips a second. So you stayed working in the system because you understood its flaws and knew what to expect.
Yes! Its like belonging to another country. Wherever you go in Europe, you have all the advantages of whatever government rules, along with the insulation of the Church.
Nothing wrong with that, Preston agreed. You mentioned the threat of molestation. Did that decline as you got older?
She kept her eyes down the road in front of them. It was worst right around puberty. I always kept my hair short and played lots of sports. Those who wanted boys could always get them and those who preferred girls seldom had interest in a Tomboy. Once or twice it was simply my turn. It wasnt so much the actual sex that hurt as the sense of having no escape. Everyone pretended nothing happened even when they saw it, so we tried to deny it to ourselves.
She was silent for awhile. Preston figured it might be the painful memories as much as the thicket of passing cars and trucks. Eventually she started talking again. Once I was no longer a captive of the system and left the orphanage, the threat changed to an entirely different kind. The priests were all about power  you had to obey. But the other predators were simply manipulative. It was less a world of fear and more of being smarter. I decided to let my hair grow out.
The road was mostly straight, rising slowly toward a wooded crest. There were a couple of sharp switchbacks at the peak of the climb, then a long straight decline toward the border. While hiking the Belgian backcountry could be a lot of fun and some of the facilities surprisingly extravagant, most of the time it was just a bit dreary. There was simply nothing pleasant about how most of the houses sat almost on the road, little or no gardens and parking laid out with no intent to please the eyes. The weeds grew thick and tall everywhere. There were nicer homes and well-kept properties, but usually off the main routes.
They were holding hands again as the street offered more chances to avoid the vehicles. Im still surprised you apparently never found anyone worth stalking until I came along. He emphasized the word stalking in a comical way.
Angie laughed. I had a couple of flings before, but they were typical boring Dutch men. Really, I was just trying to keep my head down and work with the children and teachers. Last year they talked about budgeting problems in a staff meeting, and it was serious and long-term trouble. I started checking other jobs but it seemed like the Church was ready to abandon me altogether. The secular jobs didnt appeal to me. I had been really praying and thinking a lot about it. Took a lot of long bike rides up and down the coast. When I stumbled across you that day in Katwijk, it was as if you were the only solid thing I had seen in ages. I dont know why it felt like that, but I decided to fight for it.
He put his arm around her shoulders. Baby, Ill try to be as solid for you as anything in this crazy world can be. You make it worthwhile, and then some.
She wrapped her arm around his waist and squeezed.

Chapter 13
The border crossing had become wide open since the Eurozone countries had unified their customs structure, so they were largely ignored as they turned south along a much wider highway. They had crossed the Venn Bahn once already, but it looped around and was in front of them again. Upon crossing the physical boundary, there was a subtle but distinct change as things were much better maintained. It wasnt much farther to one of the larger bike shops in town. Preston and Angie stood looking in the windows because they had actually arrived a little before the place was opened.
Angie confessed she had only ever ridden the standard Dutch commuter bikes with one speed, and would have to learn how to handle these multi-speed machines. They had time to discuss the merits of one kind of bike over another, but by the time the doors were unlocked, Preston had convinced her that the hybrids were probably the best, most versatile choice for as-yet unknown uses. Preston figured the mountain bike he had picked out in Margraten was waiting back at the orchard and there was no sense duplicating it here. And while they still had generous funds left, he suggested they stick with the middle price range. They eventually found a matched pair in their respective sizes. They also picked out matching helmets, gloves and other accessories useful for touring. He saw no reason to shift their luggage onto the bikes, having spent so many years riding with a backpack. He hoped Angie could also get used to it.
The clerk didnt hesitate to speak English. Once they were ready to pay, he first asked for their names for the warranty forms. Forttensie, Preston said.
Oh, yes, said a young woman working at a desk near the counter. She turned to her computer and did some mousing and keyboarding. She asked Preston to spell the name and she repeated each letter under her breath with the German pronunciation. She turned and said something in German to her colleague as the printer on a counter between them whirred to life and spat out a few sheets. The man gathered them and brought them back to the counter.
Yes, Mr. Forttensie, your employer sent a purchase order to cover all this. Well just transfer the information from that. All you have to do is sign here and you can ride off into the morning sun.
Preston took his copy of the order, and then showed it to Angie. The address was in Luxembourg City.
Rolling their bikes outside, Preston set the packs down at the corner of the building. He parked his bike in front of them while he talked Angie through the logic of derailleur gears. It wasnt really twenty-four speeds, but worked out to more like thirteen with some overlap. She was more worried about riding with her body down between such large diameter wheels, but found it quite comfortable. As she circled the parking lot playing with the shifters, Preston made a couple of laps ensuring the seat and handlebar heights were okay for him.
After a few minutes, she stopped and said, So where are we going on these things?
Preston stopped and picked up their backpacks, handing Angie hers and shrugging into his own. You saw the address on the order.
I thought you would say that. There are a lot of mountains between here and Luxembourg City.
He shrugged his shoulders. You remember I mentioned the Venn Bahn? That will carry us most of the way there in comfort. When I first explored this area twenty years ago the Bahn was a very rough gravel path and covered with weeds and other greenery. The map says its now mostly paved, just like the part we saw in Raeren, and crossed twice hiking down here.
He pointed her in the direction to the nearest crossing point. She started turning around to head that way. How long do you think it will take?
Im willing to bet we can do it in two days. I could make it in a day, but it would be a long, hard day. I havent seen you ride, and theres no reason to push that hard in the first place. I would hate to interfere with our honeymooning.
She giggled at that.
Take the lead, he said. I need to get used to your pace until you feel confident with the gears. Just remember: The objective is to find a comfortable cadence and shift the gears to keep it.
In less than a kilometer, they were thick in the woods.

Chapter 14
Angie! Hold up a minute, Preston called.
She slowed, and then stopped and put her feet on the ground, partially turned to look back at him. He was looking off to left along one of the straight logging cuts through the trees, pulling the camera out. He took a few shots, and then quickly unfolded the map.
Angie turned around and pedaled back to where he stood.
Darnedest thing I ever saw, he said, shaking his head as he gazed at the map. He passed the camera to her. She understood and rolled back the last few shots on the view-screen. Her eyes widened just a bit.
Weve got tour buses all over the place around here during this time of year. He chuckled as he went on, But Ive never seen one pulled that far off into the woods. The map shows a limited paved surface in there and what looks like a camping spot cleared. But a tour bus?
Well, it looks like a German charter. A little older than most you see these days. Looks like it lists a handful of cities down by the Swiss and Austrian borders. She looked up and handed the camera back. I cant imagine what they would want to see here.
I suppose it could be history buffs. The Hrtgenwald Battlefield is just a few kilometers that way, Preston said pointing ahead and off to the left a bit. Technically these trees are part of the same woodland. Plus, we are on the far northern tip of the Battle of the Bulge area. It wasnt all just Bastogne; that was simply where the war correspondents were hanging out. Those were two of the nastiest battles in World War II.
Angie shrugged. That would mean old people, because my generation hardly knows anything or cares about that stuff. Younger folks even less. What kind of camping do old people do? She was itching to get going again.
Preston put his camera away and prepared to ride off. Big tents and lots of equipment, Im guessing. I dont intend to stay around and find out. Lets go. Monschau awaits us.
The route swung around the countryside and it was almost distracting in beauty. Preston didnt want Angie to feel pushed; he wanted her to feel that in full control of riding. She was quite surprised at herself how quickly they reached Monschau. While the Venn Bahn led around the picturesque city, they decided to take the main street down into the busy town center for an early lunch. Preston also wanted to find a wifi hot spot.
He managed to get a good connection and checked the dropbox. The script found a short message. It contained an email address on a service with the Luxembourg TLD. The message told him it was his new address and that he was to create a password and check his mail ASAP.
So he logged into the server with his new account name. The system demanded that he create a new password and had a couple other hoops to jump through. The service was essentially a plain text operation with no pretty graphics at all. There was a message waiting for him and the subject was simply the numeral one with a couple of leading zeros. The message was brief:
Welcome, Mr. and Mrs. Forttensie. Got any pictures of your travels yet? I assume you are making your way here.
Preston had left his previous camera chip with their hosts near Valkenburg and started with a fresh blank. Up to that point, all he had were shots of himself and Angie in a few picturesque places. Plus he had the shots of that tour bus completely out of place in the woods. He doubted his boss had any interest in that. Still, he would offer them. He typed a reply:
We guessed the PO showed our new business address. So far, all we have are some honeymoon shots and something I thought strange: an aging tour bus out in the woods between Roetgen and Lammersdorf. What would you like to see?
He sent the message, and then poked around the interface a bit. Very Spartan it was, indeed. He was about to log out when a new message arrived. Naturally, the subject was zero-zero-two.
Very interested in the bus shots. Upload to the dropbox ASAP.
Hm. That was odd. Still, this was presumably the people paying the bills, so Preston complied. But first he removed the camera ID information from each of the images before encrypting them.
Do you suppose there is something spooky to do with buses out here in the Ardennes? She had a puzzled smile.
Preston chuckled. In this, our new career field, nothing surprises me any more.

Chapter 15
Lunch was great and Preston waited around a bit to see if anything changed on either the email or dropbox, but there was nothing. He repacked the laptop and shrugged into the backpack. Through the window he spotted a tourist shop with a rack on the sidewalk in multiple languages: Bike Routes.
Once outside he hurried across the street with Angie. He began poking around and pulled out a moderately thick booklet. Here we go. I wish they had had this at the bike shop. This covers the entire Benelux with graded bike routes and how they are marked. Perfect!
After paying for it, he handed it to Angie. Where should we go, my blushing chocolate bride?
She looked surprised. Opening the book, she looked it over a bit. Suddenly she lowered the book and looked up at him. Whats wrong with getting back on the Venn Bahn? Doesnt it go where we are headed?
Yes and no, Preston replied. The map Ive been using indicates the nice asphalt weve been riding will disappear in just a few kilometers. Our two primary choices are to parallel the Venn Bahn until we get somewhere around Saint Vith, or we can strike out south from Monschau and zigzag across the German countryside until we get to the start of the Our River. Either way, well end up on that river because it takes us down some gorgeous scenery on the eastern border of Luxembourg.
She shoved the book back at him playfully. Stop playing with my mind. Lets go to Saint Vith; Ive always wanted to see it.
He grinned and took the map book. They crossed the street and unlocked their bikes from the crowded rack. He directed her to ride south out of town, essentially chasing the Rur River upstream. The well-worn path ran parallel to the river through some woods, winding around the steep hills in that area. Just behind Reichenstein Monastery, they crossed the river on a small bridge and rejoined the Venn Bahn.
A kilometer on, the pavement came to an abrupt end in the middle of a village. A couple of mountain bikes were ahead of them picking their way along down what as now a rugged gravel track.
Preston consulted the new map book. If we take the official advice, we face a couple of steep climbs on muddy tracks. Not that much better, if you ask me. I think we should go left here and take the main road, since it goes pretty much the same place and will be easier to climb. I recall its narrow but the traffic is slow enough they can usually work around us well enough. The first part will be just a bit dreary at times, but once we get past the military base, it should be a lot nicer.
He ran through a quick reminder about how to anticipate down-shifting for hills. They rolled a few hundred meters to the N669 and began the gentle climb up the Elsenborn Ridge. Almost immediately Preston regretted it. The traffic was heavier than he expected. While it seemed the drivers took it with grace, he was uncomfortable impeding their normal operations. However, things got even a bit hairer when a small group of serious road racing riders passed them, as well.
Over the hump and around out of the woods, they could see the Venn Bahn track on their right, just across the Rur, but it was no more inviting than dealing with heavy traffic. The two routes diverged at a last stand of trees and the Venn Bahn swung east and out of sight. A thin tree line on the left suddenly opened onto the end of the airstrip at the Elsenborn base. They slowed enough to glance back up the strip and at some of the buildings. The terrain rolled up and down a bit now as they passed through more trees, and then they began seeing a large number of military structures.
In the grassy center of the traffic circle stood an armored vehicle. They stopped to admire it for a moment. Angie asked if he knew what kind of tank it was. Actually, he said, its an armored cannon. The proper term is self-propelled artillery. It has to stop and set up in order to properly fire. My understanding is that this is the prime artillery training ground for Belgian forces. During the Battle of the Bulge, it was the artillery in this area that did so much to prevent the German advance, so artillery has a really strong legacy here.
They headed south, and then dropped off the main highway. The direction signs indicated they were headed to Weywertz. The tall pines gave way to a mixture of broad leaf trees, and then opened again onto farm fields. A tiny village served almost as a suburb of Weywertz. The route sloped down to a stream valley. He called out for Angie to stop at the bridge. A small sign indicate it was called La Warche.
Pulling alongside, he pointed at the water. Look at that. Its clean enough to swim in. There arent many places Ive seen in Belgium where the water is that clear and unpolluted. Fall into the Maas and the first thing they do is detox before they even treat your injuries.
Just a short time later they ran into the Venn Bahn again, paved at that point. Preston directed Angie to turn left and follow it. Once again, the smooth wandering route carried them through the odd mixture of dilapidated properties and roads mixed with breathtaking beauty in the countryside. In Faymonville they picked up the La Warch again, just a small brook this far upstream. A short time later the Bahn split. The main path went on toward Malmedy.
Maybe we can make that on a future ride, Preston said with a hint of regret. He stood staring for a bit, and then turned toward the left where the path ended abruptly. However, it was clear by the heavily worn track in the grass where they had to go. It took them to a very nice bus station built as an oval off the street. Directly across was a gate that probably hadnt moved in decades. The signs of unfinished construction didnt keep them from seeing the route continued through there. A good bit farther on, the route ran through a traffic circle. While visually puzzling, the map book showed it picked up again just a few meters down the road. The view was blocked by a small hill covered thickly with trees.
For another hour or so they rolled across mostly open land. Here there were small streams, patches of woodland and tiny clusters of building. They crossed back and forth over the main highway several times. Just outside of Saint Vith they passed on their right a large, tightly packed cluster of tiny trailer houses. Preston always found it funny how people would pay premium rates to leave their camp trailers in a place like that only to visit for a week or two out of the year.
Once inside the town, Preston handed Angie the map again and let her wander the streets as she wished. It meant some fairly sturdy climbing, since the town was centered on top of a high hill. There really wasnt that much to the place, though it had a surprising number of new buildings and opulent pavement work for pedestrians and bikes. Toward the older center of town, the streets were very narrow. Shops lined the streets at ground level, while most of the buildings had living quarters in two or three upper floors.
Preston insisted on stopping at a bakery on the main central street. He saw through the window small tart pies with strawberries and white creamy topping. He knew from experience to ask for the ones with a chocolate lining in the shell. They enjoyed this snack sitting on one of the few benches they spotted in front of one building.
They both admitted to being tired, so after rolling a little farther down the street, they stopped at a sidewalk cafe for tea.

Chapter 16
Preston swallowed a sip of tea and put his cup down. So, Baby. Heres Saint Vith. Was it what you expected?
Oh, yes. Its beautiful. Its one of the showcases of Belgian government subsidies and historical preservation. I still think its odd how often we run across ugly sights within meters of so much beauty. Its part of what makes Belgium what it is.
Preston cocked one eyebrow. Ive already shared some of my thoughts. Tell me what your experiences have taught you about the Belgians.
Angie sipped her tea and thought for a moment. You know if I say someone is Dutch, you generally know what to expect. If I say Belgian, you have no idea what that means. In a sense, there is no such thing as a Belgian. When you have a government-recognized lobbying group called the Catholic Goat Herders Society, you get a feel for how fragmented they are. And the moment you identify with any of their various interest groups, you become the enemy of everyone who belongs to another. If you tell a Walloon you speak Flemish, you get a dirty look. If you say Dutch, which is almost word for word the same language, theyll do their best to stumble along in Flemish and treat you as a friend.
Preston said, I remember reading about the Benelux Treaty. It seems the Dutch are all progressives, dragging the Belgians into that and the EU and UN kicking and screaming the whole way. Placing NATO headquarters here seemed almost a means of keeping an eye on them. Meanwhile, the Luxembourgs actually get much the work done behind the scenes, providing tons of lawyers and banking expertise.
Nodding, she added, Do you know the TV tax scheme here in Europe? Preston nodded once. Yes, we have vans and cars rolling through the streets picking up on the signals to see who has a TV or radio and charging a small tax accordingly because there are almost no private broadcasters. So in the Netherlands, we have maybe a couple hundred drivers and vehicles with an office staff of maybe forty. In Belgium, they have maybe forty or fifty drivers but it takes over a hundred office staff to process. Thats not efficient.
Preston chuckled.
She went on. The perfect example of Belgian inconsistency: Ronquires. That inclined slope for the canal. You have seen it? Two giant rolling bathtubs that slide up and down the slope carrying barges from one part of the canal to the other. It replaces over a dozen locks from old times. You see this marvel of engineering, look down at your feet, and a smelly open sewer runs by.
They were quiet for a moment. Then Preston said, The map shows a nice camping ground down the hill from here. I was hoping we might get farther down toward the Luxembourg border on the Our River, but I think wed better stay here tonight.
Angie nodded her agreement.
Besides which, I have a feeling we need to check our mail again. With that, Preston reached into his backpack and pulled out the laptop. There were several good signals, but all were locked. He finally snagged a rather weak signal from an open node that was good enough.
Angie scooted around to see, and Preston angled it just a bit her way. Then he had her take control and run through the passwords. First was the email account. The third message:
Lucky find; not a regular tour charter. Camping reservation for you in Echternach, German side on the river, under the name Forttensie. Meet you there tomorrow. Need you to read our position on something in the dropbox.
She looked over at Preston. Let me guess: That bus has something to do with our new assignment. And maybe that barge thing, too.
Preston shrugged. She turned to log into the dropbox. The script pulled up a PDF and asked if it should be saved. She pressed Y and let it delete everything else. Preston talked her through the PDF displayer.
Oh, joy, he said sarcastically. Its in French. Thats your department, Babe.
Angie looked at the title, and then read the first paragraph, which looked to Preston like an executive summary. She looked up and said, Not here. Ill translate it for you where we wont be overheard.
They loaded up and mounted their bikes. The main route out of Saint Vith ran southeasterly. It was mostly downhill. A short time later they spotted the campground in the valley on the left. They took a narrow lane down to the entrance. The reception office told them there should be space, and pointed out a lane that ran across the creek and out the backside of the campground to another area with an open field. After riding around to see, they realized it was perfect. The field was virtually empty, and they walked through the grass to a far corner.
After setting up the tent and securing things, Preston suggested Angie read the document while he went to do laundry and scout for dinner. After getting their clothes washed and wrung out, he placed them in a plastic bag. Their tent was close to the fence, which would make a good clothesline. He found someone selling small baskets of local fruit and decided it would be a good supplement to the canned food they had packed just in case. He refilled all their empty water bottles.
When he got back, Angie was standing along the fence, staring out across the open fields. He started hanging the laundry to dry in the breeze.

Chapter 17
Eventually Angie came back to herself and helped him clip the last few items of clothing to the fence.
Must be powerful stuff in that document, he said sitting down on the edge of the ground cover.
Angie joined him. She stared down at the ground for a few moments, and then turned to face him. Was that just a hint of tears in her eyes? I thought I had a pretty rough childhood, but right under my nose was something I only suspected back in Haarlem.
She turned her body around and slid herself partway into the tent, leaving her head and shoulders sticking out, and then lay down on her back. From this position she could easily look up into Prestons face.
She went on, In America, you had the Franklin Scandal. Children being prostituted to very powerful people, used sometimes as blackmail, but mostly as some sort of demonic initiation into the power circle. We had the same thing here in Belgium with the Dutroux Affair. There were other cases that got less news coverage, but people who pay attention to such things can always find the stories. Those children were local. Now the big scandal, according to that paper, is children trafficked in from Eastern Europe and Asian countries. While there is large market for them in the general population, many of them are selected for use in the same political stuff as were previously the local children.
Preston added, So far as I know, its still pretty much local children in the US. Aside from orphans there are a surprising number of people putting their own kids into the business.
Yes, she said. That was the heart of the Dutroux Affair. Some of the important figures were the parents or other relatives of the girls involved. But Europeans have an oddly different attitude about the whole thing. Aside from a select group of middle class, we dont panic at the idea. Even I dont as a former victim. No one I knew in the orphanage system was traumatized by the sex. But we werent used that heavily. Kids who are forced to work prostitution are really torn down by it. We see the difference most Americans dont see. I dont like our Dutch casual attitude about sex, but I also dont like the crazy ... schizophrenic way Americans handle it.
Preston nodded in agreement. I noticed that the first time I was here in Europe. For the most part, Americans are more corrupt but refuse to admit to themselves. So when theyre bad, their hideous and extreme. Meanwhile, everyone tends to think in simplistic absolutes of black and white.
Exactly, Angie said. I hated the abuse, but it didnt make me crazy. Im not bitter. Im angry with the abusers individually, perhaps, but not the whole world  certainly not the system. This paper points out this whole problem of sexual abuse of children is fully part of a much bigger picture of sexual stupidity in general. Pulling it out of that context destroys the one hope we have for helping the victims. It said this is something found in all cultures, but seems far worse in the West. That we make such a big noise of stopping it in absolute terms reflects the very weakness in our culture that makes it happen so much.
So, why do you suppose our boss wanted us to read it?
She rolled over onto her side to face him, propping her head up on one elbow. Apparently he is involved in this research, and may even have written the paper. It was presented at a conference for lawyers, though it sounds more like social research. The paper hints he would like to offer a better private setting for victim recovery, but no European government will give any room. He suggests that is primarily because major figures in all government are involved in the trade, benefit from it in one way or another. The paper mentions various scandals where the cases are bungled in such a way neither the perpetrators nor the investigators get into any real trouble.
Preston asked, So what does he propose to do about it?
Well, you know demand for this trafficking is only going to grow. The ordinary people drawn into this are the ones who get caught and prosecuted. The powerful people will seldom really get prosecuted. So the only way this business shuts down, or even slows, is through independent publication. With the Internet, there are more ways than ever to expose these people. What usually happens at the very least is the victims get to escape as much as they are going to. Whether anyone will demand changes is another matter, but the very best anyone can do really is simply exposing the situation.
Hmm, Preston said, looking up into the sky. He glanced back at Angie. So in essence we are asked to be investigative reporters. We travel around and take pictures and catch these goons at their work. We probably wont really stop anything, but we can make it more difficult and offer some limited rescue for the victims. Meanwhile, we rely on our guardian angels to keep us out of trouble until its our time to go. Does that sound about right?
She laughed and fell over on her back. Gazing up at him, she said, I suppose thats it.
Actually, I rather hope its not much more than that. Im really not that interested in physical confrontation. I dont mind bashing heads when its necessary, but it seems to me that Ive never really had to do that much fighting. We killed two thugs with just a can of tire foam. Thats too close for my comfort as it is.
Angie made an unpleasant face. Me, too. But I can surely get behind something like this, regardless of the risks. I agree there is little more we can do that would actually help. Making bigger changes would mean more blood than I want to imagine.
Later that night, as they lay in each others arms, Angie asked, Preston, did you raise children?
Yep; sired my share. Started early and got them up and almost out of the house before their mother went crazy on me.
She sighed. Okay, because when I was young I had my tubes tied to avoid getting pregnant by those horrible men. I was hardly the only one; it was a common thing. The state recommended it for us and the orphanage could not prevent it, despite their teachings. I thought it was the best thing for me. I would have loved any child, but could not bear the idea of getting pregnant while still just a child myself.
She was silent for a moment, and then added, I suppose that is why I continued working with children as an adult. Funny, but it looks like I still am working with them, though perhaps indirectly now.
If our guessing is correct, Preston added.

Chapter 18
The road south out of Saint Vith ran more or less parallel with an autobahn. However, the autobahn was born aloft on very high pylons, while the lesser route Preston and Angie took dropped rapidly down to the valley floor of the Our River.
Because of the complexity of the route, Angie wanted Preston to lead. He had the measure of her pace and was able to back off just enough for her to keep up. At the bottom of the valley, there was a sharp right onto a gravel version of the Venn Bahn, very well packed and smooth. Preston intended to follow the river as closely as possible. For the first portion of their journey, that meant mostly following similar tracks and trails, winding over nearly level ground on one bank or the other.
After a few kilometers of lovely quiet travel through mostly wooded trails, they were forced onto the main road for a short bit. The river made a series of hair pin switch backs and there were twin villages straddling this river. Oddly, the one farther west was on the German side while the eastern was Belgian. Preston slowed, turned and pointed out the campground had first hoped they could reach. It was packed, so they agreed things had turned out for the best. A short way farther, the paved road ran out into gravel track, which in turn became a narrow woodland trail. Still, it was firm and they had no trouble. They simply enjoyed the picturesque rapid switchbacks in the waters course, stopping now and then to use the camera.
Eventually they ran onto a substantial highway. Thats the end of the trails, Preston yelled back. The highway offered a bike lane, which they shared with a surprising number of hikers and other cyclists. As they rolled along, the wide flat valley turned into a steep draw as the land on either side shot up into hills and mountains.
At about mid-morning they reached a place called Biven where the river nearly bent back on itself. Only a high ridge prevented it forming an island. The ridge jutted northward from the surrounding land, around which the river made this tight loop. Meanwhile, the watercourse was quite a bit wider, almost a narrow lake. Then they saw the dam that made it so. A short time later found them stopping to admire Vianden Castle. They took their time rolling slowly through the area, as both the natural and man-made scenery was thrilling to behold. The camera simply could not capture what they saw. Eventually the Our River joined the Sre tumbling down out of the central Luxembourg highlands.
Below Vianden, the river valley broadened again in a few places. At one point they crossed back over to the German side and followed a road that stuck closer to the riverbank. Just before lunch, they rolled into the German side of Echternach. Roughly eighty kilometers in less than six hours; it wasnt so much the workout of cycling, because they were riding a gentle down slope the whole way. It was the saddle soreness of new bike seats that hadnt yet been worn into the shapes of their bottoms.
At the front desk of the campground, the old woman pointed to a spot on the map that she said in German was reserved especially for them. It was right up against the old bridge below the pizzeria they passed on the way to the entrance of the campground. The campground was packed, but when they rode back up to the driveway of the pizza house and were able to find a way down and around to the graveled bank. There were no tents there at the time, so they chose a spot close to the retaining wall.
By the time their tent and other gear was all set up, the smell of fresh pizza was driving them crazy, so it was back up the same way for lunch.
When they returned, there were three new tents not far from theirs. The occupants were all younger. After an initial greeting, the youngsters chattered excitedly about their plans for rock climbing in Berdorf, a short distance back upriver. This part of Luxembourg is known as Little Switzerland because of the many high rocky crags. When the kids wandered off for their own lunch, Preston and Angie lay back on the grassy slope near their tent.
The must have dozed off because someone was asking for them by their alternative names. Preston vaguely remembered only using any names at all with the camp registry. When he opened his eyes, it was a fellow in rather expensive cycling gear, standing back a bit holding his even more expensive racing bike upright against his hip. They sat up and Preston said, Hello. The man leaned his bike against the wall nearby, and then sat next to them, removing his helmet and gloves. Anyone would have thought him a dashing manly fellow, rather handsome and tall.
Im so glad you made it. No one had any idea if you could ride that far, but I was told you two were rather fit, so it seemed a good bet. He held out his hand and shook each in turn. You can call me Gary.
He turned and glanced at their bikes. I believe you two made good choices for the kind of riding you do. Money well spent. He turned and regarded them with a benign smile.
We liked your paper, Gary, Angie offered.
Good, good. Can we take a stroll? He pointed under the old bridge.
They rose and began walking slowly alongside. Gary clasped his hands behind his back. I did contribute to that paper, and Im hoping to get translations made soon. I was told one of you could handle French, and apparently it is so. I take it youre on board with this?
Preston spoke up, If I understand things correctly, it would be hard to imagine work we would enjoy more. We guessed it is something rather like investigative photographers plus a little more.
Good way of putting it, Gary said. They were under the bridge, in the shadow and out of earshot from any other people, so Gary stopped and faced them. I work in an international law firm, and part of my responsibilities include banking law, treaties and publishing. We are private partners sharing the management of several businesses. On paper, you are contracted to the publishing house. He pulled out a business card with his name, the company name and yet another address in Luxembourg City.
It was then Preston first noticed the man wore rather large a fanny pack. He had slipped it around to one side where he could reach it easily. He pulled out another object in a dark plastic wrapper. This is a lawyers type of cellphone that we use. Some numbers are pre-programmed. In the bag are two extra SIM cards. Im sure you are able to figure out when to use them. When its off, its really off. The encryption is very powerful. No one can track you without special permission. Youll use it to call us more than us calling you.
He reached into the bag again and produced yet another darkly wrapped bundle somewhat larger. This should take care of your camera problems. Its got a fat hard drive and can hold two extra memory cards. The battery is pretty long life and youll have more extensive controls, better lens and better zoom. The lights can be turned off and the screen muted to the point only someone right next to you can see it, yet it can obtain fairly sharp images in the very lowest light conditions. Im sure you can figure it out.
He glanced around a bit, and then touched his finger to his lips. The man you sprayed was partly involved in this awful trade in human flesh. The dead body on the barge was going to blow the whistle. You already know they play for keeps. Had the whistle blower called us first, she might still be alive to talk. Your assailants death puts some of their business on hold. Meanwhile, the children are still being brought into the area and sold off to pimps. The bus you saw was a load of them. They clone the names of real travel agencies, but with a slightly different spelling. Thanks to your sharp eye, we know where to look for the latest distribution point.
Gary paused a moment. We work though all sorts of various agencies; thats not your concern. Just get us the info and things will happen. Try to avoid contact with anyone but our people. Fighting for you life is fine, but we have no heroes.
Preston nodded, Amen to that.
Gary chuckled. One more thing. I need to you spend a day or two hanging out with the climbers in Berdorf. Among them is an American who pretends to be Belgian. He is a new recruit for the bad guys and we need a picture if you can identify him.
Gary glanced at his watch. Then he grabbed them each by the hand, shaking in the same manner as Mr. Venkman. Thank you so much. Your hosts back in Valkenburg will cashier your pay. He abruptly turned and nearly ran back to his bike. In seconds he had his riding gear back on and was walking his bike up to the pavement.
Preston looked at the two packages. Wow. This is more work than I ever thought I could do.

Chapter 19
The biggest shock was inside the wrapper of the camera.
There were two passports from some small Caribbean nation in their fake names and matching Eurail passes. That should smooth things out a bit, eh Daphne?
Angie chuckled. Ill try to get used to that name. Angie I like, but Daphne feels rather pretentious for me.
Preston checked and all the proper border stamps were there. Then he noticed the images were current. Wonder how they did that?
I would guess it was that information booth in Rotterdam. It would be easy to hide a camera in all that stuff, Angie suggested. I seem to recall there was a blank wall directly behind us. She pointed to the background in the passport photos.
Oh well, the less we know, the better it is for everyone. He stuffed his US passport inside a utility bag inside his backpack, along with his monthly Dutch train pass.
Angie copied his actions with her EU ID card. She looked at her Dutch rail pass and sighed. It will expire next month any way.
They spent the evening in their tent examining the two new pieces of equipment. Preston discovered that the camera could upload live video feeds via a long cable to the cellphone. He could keep the phone out of sight in a pocket while uploading. The contacts list included one marked upload. He showed it to Angie. Better than bluetooth, because wireless can be intercepted. Our boss really splashed out some serious moolah.
Angie was frankly excited. She was enthusiastic about tomorrow, too. She had only heard of Little Switzerland and was itching to try some of the easier climbs.
So the next morning, they pushed their bikes inside the tent and locked them together. Then they hiked across the bridge for breakfast. There were so very many different cafes and restaurants that they just picked one at random and had a fine breakfast of sausages and eggs.
The hike up the valley was just a kilometer or so before it offered access to the wooded trails. They followed it back around the promontory overlooking their campground. Preston experimented with the camera a bit, as always, looking for the most unusual angle. Then he handed the camera to Angie and she tested a few ideas. He told her, Im very proud to say, my sweet apprentice, you are just about ready to work without supervision.
She grabbed him around the neck and they almost slipped off the trail ledge together. They had a good laugh and continued up and down the trails. The place was dotted with stairs cut into the rock face. The early morning rush of climbers was already under way.
Angie started shooting some of the action while Preston watched. She managed a couple of easy free climbs and took a few shots from the top.
The whole time he was trying to think what sort of thing a younger person might do that would give away an American upbringing. With so many young Europeans spouting lines from American films and other popular English phrases, it was clear that wasnt any kind of clue.
So they spent two days this way, hiking in the mornings around the area with the camera, taking extensive footage. Theyd grab lunch on the way back and try to examine all the videos as privately as possible. On the second day, Preston saw something that caught his eye. Angie was at the controls.
Back up one. Yeah. Now zoom in on that one. He pointed to one of the faces. The young fellow had his thumb up and pointed back over his shoulder. Do Dutch or Belgian kids do that?
What? The raised thumb? Its a rude gesture, which means most kids do it.
Its not just the raised thumb, but pointing with it, he explained.
They began checking other footage and saw him twice more. They also noticed that not a single one of the other kids used that gesture in quite that way. Lets hope hes still around tomorrow and doesnt notice us.
There really were no other good candidates, so the next day they hunted around the climbing areas where they had caught him every time so far. He wasnt there. After a long wait, they decided to hike around a bit. They had no luck. They decided to have lunch at the friture out front of the campground up in Berdorf.
Preston spotted their quarry. He was sitting next to one of the tents, packing up his gear. As carefully as possible, Preston opened the camera, then nudged it around until the young fellow was in the frame and started recording video. The fellow sat chattering more than working on packing his gear. Preston watched as several times the fellow used his thumb to point. Apparently his friends were used to it, though they didnt copy the action.
Angie and Preston made an effort to avoid any further behavior that wasnt casual. They took their time, and when the food was gone, they slowly got up chattering in Dutch. Then they took the shortest route back down to the campsite near the bridge. Preston felt a strange sense of needing to hurry. Not because it was the last day they had planned to stay, but something he couldnt quite identify. He advised Angie to start some of the packing. Even this late in the day, they probably needed to be somewhere else soon.
The open wifi nodes were strong and plentiful down by the river. He processed the video footage into a single file, and then added a few still shots from the other shooting. These were bundled and encrypted, then uploaded to the drop box. He added a quick message on the mail server:
High probability in the dropbox. Feel like getting out of Dodge.
Then he finished packing up the rest of the stuff. Angie asked rather quietly, Where to?
Preston had been holding something in his mouth while using his hands to fold it. Upon extracting the item, he quietly said, Trier.
Keeping to the German side of the river, they pedaled a few kilometers downriver to Ralingen. Just outside the village, Preston steered onto a wood path on the left side. Checking now and then to make sure Angie was keeping up, he geared down and began following a switch back climb up the ridge. It was hard and slow, at times requiring they dismount, but they got over the top and coasted a short way along a paved road into the village of Kersch. From there it was mostly crooked back roads. The route took them down into a valley and over the next ridge, then another valley and ridge. The windmill farm would have been more interesting had they the time to look. As they dropped off the next slope, their lane ran into a major road, past a very large industrial park, and it was almost all downhill into Trier.
At times they rode the brakes pretty hard on switchbacks, but eventually got down into the city. It was such a beautiful place, very ancient, perched on the banks of the Mosel. Again, Preston had little time to look around until they crossed the busy downtown section to the train station.
He had Angie negotiate passage for the bikes. They were in luck, because they could ride in the car with them. He consulted the schedule and a map displayed nearby. After a couple of times back and forth, he whispered to Angie, I think Herzogenrath is a good target. If it feels comfortable, well go on to Heerlen. From there I could find my way home in the dark.
Once they were on the train, he encouraged her to nap if she could, but she had too many questions in her mind. He closed his eyes, but sleep was far away.

Chapter 20
There were a couple of layovers and train swaps, but each time the bikes were not much of a problem. The special cars were marked with a bike symbol.
It was nearly dark when they arrived at Herzogenrath. Preston decided it was safe to ride the train on into Heerlen, but they had to change trains for it. While they were waiting, the station was nearly empty.
Angie glanced around, and then asked, Can you tell me whats the hurry?
Maybe Im just stupid, but my instincts said someone else was onto us there. Not the kid we were looking for, but maybe someone else watching him. Whether it was his friends or not, it just seemed it wasnt friendly with us. I dont get spooked that often, so I went with it.
She stretched up and kissed his cheek. Thats good enough for me.
They sat in silence for a few moments. Then he added, My hunch also was that they werent easily able to follow bicycles. In the direction we went, we could have gone almost anywhere. That same route could allow us to circle back around where the Mosel swallows the Sre just south a ways from Echternach. Im willing to bet our boss came from that direction, because the main highway goes over to Luxembourg City from there.
A moment later, he continued, I didnt want whoever it was to think anything at all, really, just that we were gone. One of the nice things about traveling by bicycle is nobody pays much attention to you. Unless they can actually follow us somehow, they arent likely to get random witnesses to say whether they even remembered us.
Finally their train pulled into the station. Once aboard, they decided to ride all the way to Schin op Geul. From there, it was only a short ride, but a steep uphill climb right at first.
They were never so glad to see the red door of their apartment again.

Chapter 21
The message came in their email the next morning.
Bingo; good eye. We believe someone tried to follow you. Heres hoping you succeeded in losing them. Rescued about half the bus kids; another setback for them. Send more ordinary shots for our general collection.
They spent the day relaxing and organizing their work. Angie turned out to be quite good at it, and he insisted she needed a bigger system to work with here at home. Then he got up and stood behind her, pulling apart the braids as she worked. He brushed her hair out thoroughly, and then began rubbing her shoulders and back. She groaned and nearly collapsed face down on the little table. She slept hard that night. The next morning, she returned the favor, and then some.
As they lay clinging to each other, Preston observed, We broke the rules.
She raised her head up, What rules?
You climbed the rocks and were away from me. I could see you, but we werent physically close, he explained.
You encouraged me.
Yes, I did. Sometimes the rules dont apply, like when we were camping in Saint Vith. Still, we have to be careful. He kissed her forehead. Id hate to have someone steal you from me now.
She giggled that enchanting girlish sound.
After breakfast, he asked their hostess how he should go about getting Angie a good workstation. She thought for a moment. Suddenly she said, Leftovers.
Leftovers? Not much of that in our refrigerator. He was pretty sure she didnt mean food and grinned at his own joke.
She laughed. Not food; computers. Every business buys that stuff. Some buy lots of it. Let me check amongst our associates. You may need to pay something but that should still be less than retail or even wholesale. Then I want you to check it thoroughly for anything thats out of place, because we never really trust anyone. She turned and started for the door. Give me a day or so and Ill let you know.
He turned to Angie. Meanwhile, I think we need to go back to where we started.
Wablieft? She was puzzled.
Preston grinned. Geographically. I still have some stuff I left in my room at Harrys place, and I need it. Electronic gadgets, tools, software, so forth.
Oh. Then maybe I can take a formal letter of departure to the school. I dont have anything there I need, but they will want me to take my stuff away. She went to find some paper and a pen.
They hiked cross-country into Wijlre and caught the train. While waiting, Preston decided to test his new cellphone, sending a text message he hoped Harry would read before they arrived. Angie composed her letter as they rode. A couple of train changes and they got off around noon at Hazerswoude, just a few kilometers from Hoogmade. It was their good fortune to find the fish wagon in one of the parking lots near the river. It was essentially a motor home converted into a sea food shop on wheels. Such vehicles typically kept a regular route through villages too small for any kind of full service locally. There was a similar thing with grocery wagons. The fish wagon also had frying vats behind the counter, so lunch was quick and easy, eating fried breaded cod wrapped in paper as they walked.
There was no direct route, but taking a narrow lane along the polders required only an hour to reach the marina. Naturally, Harry hadnt seen the message. He wasnt even around the place. Preston gathered his small collection and stuffed it into a couple of travel bags. He didnt relish lugging the baggage, but it had to be. They caught the bus and worked their way to Haarlem. It was only a few hundred meters to the school from where they got off.
Angie had warned him he couldnt come inside the place. Much as he didnt like losing sight of her, he agreed to wait in a small open area nearby with a couple of benches. He poked around his conscious mind a bit and decided the uncomfortable feeling was just a feeling. It was nonetheless an unpleasant wait. His pocket beeped a notice of incoming text message. Had she reactivated her old phone?
No, it was Harry. He was sorry he missed his friend and insisted they not lose touch. Preston knew Harry couldnt sit still for ten minutes unless he was sailing. During the few weeks he had stayed at Harrys place, Preston spent less than two hours total time with him. They would keep in touch by email and the forums, but Prestons life was on a totally different track right now.
The distraction did him good, because he was surprised to see Angie walking back toward him with a large nylon duffel bag, and her small backpack was now bulging. She sat down next to him and they kissed. I didnt realize how much it would bother me, she said.
What bother?
Being away from you, silly boy. If it is addiction, I dont want a cure. Then she added, Oh, and they seemed almost happy to see me go.
She insisted on a detour to a shop front near the center of the old city. It was a charity clothing place, and she left the larger bag. Preston wished he had known she was going to do that, but didnt want to rifle through his belongings now to separate out what he could keep.
It was a long ride and several train changes back to Wijlre. They had eaten dinner from the snack cart on the train, and it was still light out as the train pulled up to the platform. They decided to grab the bus that took them to Scheulder up on the ridge and much closer to the orchard. Angie pestered him until he gave her the smaller bag, but it was still work and they stopped twice on the way to rest.
They were a bit surprised to encounter their hostess outside their door as they came into the courtyard. Good news! Dont unpack, she announced.

Chapter 22
Sweating from the burdened hike, this was hardly what Preston was expecting.
Their hostess opened the door for them. Patiently waiting until they unburdened themselves, she turned one of the chairs around from the table and faced where they sat in the two easy chairs.
Heerlen is one of the best places to hide. You can disappear so easily in such a busy town. When we got an offer of a computer, the same person mentioned they would love to have a house sitter.
Angie and Preston glanced at each other, eyebrows raised.
First, you can never meet this person. Its best you never look into the details; this protects everyone, as you know. On one of the central walking promenades in Heerlen, there is a top floor apartment above one of the shops. You access it from either the front or from an alleyway in the back. There is a crazy legal status I cant explain, but this person cannot use the property for business nor rent it out, yet are required to keep it up. Its quite valuable so they want someone to occupy it for security reasons. They estimate its at least two years before anything changes.
She crossed her legs and smiled. You can move in tomorrow morning. They left you a nice Mac system there. I was told you should simply rely on wifi, and Im sure you can work that out. Its not that we are eager to see you go, but this is so much better for you two.
Preston thought for a moment. I rather like the idea it reduces your risks, too.
She smiled, but said nothing.
Angie stood and walked over to the older lady. Bending a bit, she gave her a hug. We kunnen niet genoeg bedanken. We cant thank you enough.
The woman returned her warmth. You two have opened many doors for us. It would all be worth it simply for what youve already done.
As she got up to leave, Preston stood and hugged her, too.
Weve asked a friend to bring up a small truck to help you move. Hell be here mid-morning, so you should have plenty of time to get ready. She gently closed their door behind her. They never saw her again.
Next morning, the small truck pulled up in the courtyard around nine. You would have thought with so few worldly possessions, they could have easily been ready. Somehow, it didnt quite work out that way. They were still packing the last few items as the truck arrived.
The ride into Heerlen was mercifully short in the cramped front seat of the little van. Their baggage and three bikes easily fit into the back. Only during the early morning hours could he have driven on any part of the walking plazas, so he had to park a ways off at the train station. However, he had a dolly and was able to help them with the baggage. They wheeled their bikes to the back of the building. There was a small steel rolling door with the obvious purpose of bicycle storage. The man spoke nary a word, simply pointing and smiling. He handed Preston a key for this door, then another key to Angie. The old fellow waited at the bottom of the stairs while they located the apartment. It took only a few trips and he disappeared when they last bag left his dolly.
Something in the layout screamed at Preston that one small room had to be their office. Sure enough, in a corner under a small, simple table sat some boxes. He pulled the two aging but serviceable rolling office chairs back from the table and slid the boxes out across the hardwood floor.
Inside was a complete Mac workstation of recent vintage with a large monitor. While Angie unpacked their clothing and other stuff, he fetched his computer tools and took a look inside the case. There was nothing suspicious, but he wanted to double check. He fired up his laptop. Sure enough, there were dozens of wifi nodes in the area. He picked at random one of the unsecured ones and looked up a site that offered complete tear-down instructions for Macs. He checked everything, including the cables.
By matching the images, he decided there was nothing amiss and reassembled the case. That didnt mean things were perfect. Among the parts in the box was a wifi router. After getting the system up and running, but before connecting the router, he pulled a disk from his collection and inserted it. Mac is Unix with a pretty face, and he had some scripts that took advantage of this to make it more secure. It included a very smart firewall and some other measures to lock down the system against unsafe changes.
Angie walked in asking about how he wanted some of his clothing put away and stopped when she saw the system running. It was embarrassingly opulent. He quickly plugged in the wifi as she watched him get her online. Rolling back in his chair, he pointed to the system with his open hands. There you go, Baby. It doesnt get any better than this.
She was clearly impressed. She sat down and began playing with it. He left it to her and went to the bedroom so she could work without worrying about his stuff.
With restaurants, cafes, snack-bars and grocery shops aplenty in easy walking distance, food was never an issue. The apartment was fully furnished, aside from linen. Again, shops within walking distance covered every need. Everything in the apartment was obviously well used, but certainly better than nothing. As they were working away on their photographs that evening, Preston looked over at Angie and said aloud, I didnt notice dying, so how did I get to heaven? The only thing missing are the wings on your back.
She turned with a big smile, leaned over and kissed him. Dont be silly. We still have a lot of work to do. Im betting our bicycles will not rest much in that lock-up downstairs.
Preston grinned. Well then, well have to play angels on wheels while the real angels guarding us will never get much rest for their wings.

Part 3  Of Children and Angels

Chapter 23
It was time for a bit more mundane work.
Besides, Preston had not been this close to the old POMCUS site since coming back to the Netherlands. It was a short ride east across Heerlen, through Landgraaf and then Abdissenbosch. They turned left along the primary northerly route, which offered fine bike paths. The entrance to the golf course was just visible down the road where they turned off into the woods. This took them to a road running right along the Dutch-German border.
Preston wanted to see the site from the backside first. While he never was sure what the company was doing digging into the old slag heap from the ancient coal mining days, he saw how a great mound had been reduced from his military days.
They followed the route around to the north side of the complex, and then turned left along the main road. In large cities like this, bike paths were everywhere and very well maintained with their own traffic lights. The road curved around back south and they could see the large metal warehouses up on the high flat ground. From what he could tell, Preston realized this particular site had been expanded considerably, and reasoned some of the equipment from the sites that they closed had been brought here.
They turned left again and climbed up to follow the street along the fence line. Preston had heard the entire operation throughout the Netherlands had been turned over to Dutch contractors. There was not an American uniform anywhere, just armed Dutch guards and other functionaries.
The administrative offices had been moved, but the main gate was in the same place. There was an old guard sitting there just outside the door of the shack enjoying the breeze. Preston rolled up as close as he dared.
Hallo! He waved at the guard.
The man waved back with the typical Dutch friendliness, but said nothing.
I used to work here!
The guard perked up and stood, moving to the corner of the gatehouse. His accent was very thick. That would be a long time ago. The Americans left it to us ten years ago.
So I heard. A lot of things have changed. Preston agreed.
Ja. Do you know they finally closed the old Schinnen Camp?
Preston was a little surprised. I knew they had reduced its status, but I wasnt aware they were closing it. They had spent so very much money fixing the place up. He pushed his bike a meter or two closer.
Ja. DSM is trying to find someone else to rent it. But the other NATO allies would not let the Americans just walk away from this area. So the made them keep a reduce section up at old Brggen  Javelin Barracks, I think they call it now. The old man was enjoying the conversation.
That would be just over on the German side. I remember we used to use a firing range up there in the woods near Herkenbosch.
The old man nodded. Ja, I worked here long enough to remember that. Now the few American troops could almost walk there from the airbase. Its just a few American MPs and some civilians. The Brits offered them some space when they deactivated some units. Pretty soon there wont be nearly so many NATO folks around. Ah, we dont worry about no Ruskies. We trade with them now. The old man laughed heartily.
Thanks for your time, sir. We have some other places to visit. Preston waved. The old man seemed just a bit disappointed it was over so soon.
They rode back down the street to the main road and turned left. As they approached the high plateau, Preston noticed there was not a trace of the old mining buildings at the JHQ, formerly called AFCENT HQ. The old AFCENT International School, previously a collection of single-story prefab buildings strung together, was now a huge multi-story building and a sign said AFNORTH.
They had been stopping to take photos all morning, but carefully avoided aiming the cameras at any of the military structures. There were plenty of other interesting shots. That included the ancient cable wheel removed from the top of the mineshaft and mounted as a monument in a small park right beside the main gate.
Angie was curious. I dont remember what happened. Did the mines just play out?
Preston snorted. No. The Americans and their ultra-cheap strip mining put the Dutch State Mines out of business. With the unions here and all those safety regulations against our terribly unsafe operations and hideous earth scars, we undercut you guys and put thousands of people out of work. Those were bad times in the Benelux.
She pursed her lips. So thats why DSM does no mining at all, just chemicals and stuff.
Yeah. They still own all those mine camps and NATO was a good paying renter. Those days are about gone, it seems. We had a huge number of supporting operations all over the Netherlands, not just the POMCUS sites. It was extravagant for a long time  missile sites, life support services, all sorts of secret communications bunkers. I only heard about the places we had people. About all thats left now are the places directly involved in NATO coordination activity itself.
Preston pointed out how the original coal train path was now a bike path. They decided to follow it around to Schinnen. It was a long quiet ride through Hoensbroek. At some places the route was simply gone, at other places it was an actual street, but there werent that many detours. It wound down around the picturesque village of Terschuren with its beautifully kept ancient stone cottages. They took lots of pictures there.
Eventually they got back on the route that went through some woods, then alongside a sand and gravel operation used by Dutch Rail, very close to the tracks. Then the path turned and required they run alongside the built up highway where it bridged over the rail line, cross over the top, and dove through some foliage. It closely paralleled the railroad. On the other side, the trail continued. By that time, the landscape had been changed so much that the original route disappeared. However, a fine wooded path remained along much of it and they took what was available.
Part of it was elevated above the surrounding terrain. The last section running along the backside of Schinnen Mine was inaccessible, thickly grown over with trees and shrubs. It had been just barely possible to crawl through it twenty years before, but was impassable altogether now. They turned and followed the main route toward what had been the one gate into the old complex. While a bike path on the left ran along between the fence and train tracks on the south side of the site, they stopped at the gate and gazed into the now abandoned facility.
Except for the original headquarters building and one or two other structures, the place was all new buildings, now vacant. The duck pond was overgrown with weeds, but the ducks were still there. It was actually the first sediment pond from the water treatment system. The water passed from there back under the roadway to a wooded fish pond. Preston decided hed seen enough and they turned to go back.

Chapter 24
At the crossing, they turned right and promptly dismounted their bikes. They climbed up on the tiny train platform. In due time, a small train arrived headed south to Heerlen.
They arrived at the station just a couple hundred meters from their apartment. The train stopped next to the large open parking plaza on the south end of the station. Angie was walking her bike in the direction of their apartment.
Wait, Preston caught her.
She stopped and looked back. He motioned her to follow.
We arent going home yet. I wanna have lunch at a particular place. She raised her eyebrows in a half smile and humored him. They rode about a half-kilometer back up the tracks on the south side to a busy traffic circle, following it around to cross under the autobahn. As they rode down the bike path, she saw up on a small hill to their right a large building with a toucan sign perched high up on a pole. She looked at it, then back at Preston. He was grinning broadly as the slowed to enter the drive on the right.
The Van Der Valk Hotel had plenty of bicycle parking and was quite busy. As they climbed the stairs to the buffet lounge, Preston told her how often he and his coworkers had eaten there. Aside from redecorating and refurbishing, little had changed. It was still an opulent spread and not a bad price. They eventually found open seats at a table in one of the side dining areas opened to accommodate the crowd.
After a few stories, he was silent a moment as he watched her.
Is something wrong? she asked.
Youve been pretty quiet today, he observed.
This was your day to reminisce. Its all fascinating, but so completely foreign to me. Its part of what makes you so exotic and interesting. She beamed at him.
Tell me about exotic, my chocolate redheaded lover, with the sexy little athletic body.
She blushed and that girlish giggle slipped past her lips, forcing her to cover her mouth in the middle of chewing.
He went on, Im very glad you dont flaunt it. Leave it to their imagination; its all mine.
She continued laughing, fanning herself with one hand and covering her mouth with the other. It took a moment for her to finally say, No one has ever talked to me that way. I love it, but its hard to know what to say back.
Just enjoy it, Babe; get used to it. Im going back for some dessert. Need anything?
No, Ive already had too much. This place is wonderful.
Preston wandered off toward the buffet as her eyes followed him. She half wondered if she should have tried to follow him, remembering the words of Mr. Venkman. Were they still at risk?
Suddenly her eyes focused on a womans face. She and Preston had been sitting back near the far corner of the little overflow dining area and the woman walked past the opening in the main area. Angie raised her hand to her face. She wasnt sure why, but something about that face made her very nervous.
As soon as the woman disappeared from her line of sight, Angie tried to act her most casual self as she rose and began looking for Preston. She spotted him among the desserts, apparently unable to make up his mind. As he reached out to pick up a piece of mixed fruit vlaai, one of the shallow flat Dutch pies, she walked up very close to him and spoke quietly.
Put it in a doggie bag. I think we have company. She then placed a hand on his shoulder as she turned to scan the room again. She didnt see the woman in the crowd.
Preston kept his cool, noticed where she was looking and placed his slice of pie in a plastic container from the stack placed there for the purpose. Then he turned, took her hand with his free one, and walked out the front door. Outside he remained calm as they descended the stairs, then turned and walked around the building the opposite end of where Angie had been searching. He pulled from his pocket a thin plastic shopping bag and dropped the desert into it so he could sling it across the handlebars. They found their bikes and casually rolled back out the side entrance and disappeared rather quickly down an alternate route for bicycles only.
When they were more or less alone, he asked, So, tell me what you saw.
I cant be sure. I was just sitting there thinking about Mr. Venkmans advice to stay together when she walked across my line of sight. The face was vaguely familiar, but not someone I actually recognized. I cant place her, but it made me very nervous.
I had almost forgotten about that.
The path turned into the woods. They rode a few more meters, and then he put up his hand. With is finger on his lips, he dismounted and stood to one side of the trail. She copied his action. They stood silently for a few minutes, looking through the trees back down the path across the open field. After a few minutes of not seeing anything unusual, he began examining their bikes closely. Eventually he was satisfied nothing had been added to them; he motioned her to remount and did the same. They rode off, crossing a small brook, winding through the trees to another main road. Crossing back under the autobahn, they headed home.
They took an unusual route and stopped a couple of times. Preston was waiting to see if she saw any more familiar faces.

Chapter 25
He opened the door to their apartment slowly.
The small, thin transparent plastic chip he always placed on top of the door when they left fell exactly where it should have. Unless someone was looking for such a thing, they would never see it. They closed the door. Virtually all exterior doors in the Netherlands lock automatically. They could be opened from the inside, but only with a key from the outside. They had also installed a deadbolt, and Preston locked this, too.
After checking the sparely furnished apartment and seeing nothing out of place, they dared to breathe a sigh of relief.
Preston smiled and took her in his arms. Heres hoping it was nothing, just someone you had seen before somewhere. A strange coincidence, maybe.
She said nothing for awhile as she snuggled against him. Looking up at him she said, It really bothers me why I cant place her, because Im normally pretty clear on such things.
Yes, you are. But there is nothing we can do. Maybe I should give you some of the lessons my supervisor taught me back when I worked over at the storage site. He had a long tour in Korea and earned his first level black belt in Taekwondo.
She pulled back and looked up at him. I thought you didnt like violence.
I dont. But just because I try to avoid it doesnt mean I dont know how to do it. Had our Israeli man gotten out of that car, I might not have beaten him, but it would not have been easy for him without a weapon.
Thats good to know. Id rather rely on my running ability.
She pulled away and headed to the little office. Im going to take a look at our photos from Valkenburg first. I need to see if I can recognize her face.
And Im going to make myself remember that not even dessert in a ritzy hotel should separate us, he said with a strained chuckle.
Angie did manage to recognize the face of the woman they thought tried to sabotage the SUV up in Margraten, but it was not the woman at the buffet. After several hours of this, she decided her mind was too tired and strained and had lost any hope of recognizing much of anything.
Preston had been working beside her most of the time, processing the photos they had taken that morning on their tour of Brunssum and Schinnen. He was viewing some touristy websites when she turned to face away from the computer.
Rubbing her eyes, Angie said, No luck. I give up.
He turned toward her and spun her chair around to face him. Taking both her hands, he reassured her. There is only so much we can do. The one thing of which we can be certain is our angels were warning us not to break the rules again.
She smiled and nodded.
He continued. How about some kayaking? We can catch a train over to Maastricht, Liege, Namur and change to Dinant. Theres a place to lock the bikes there, then we ride the train up La Lesse to the launch point. It takes half the day if we start right after breakfast.
She was suddenly excited. Oh, Id love that!
Good, he said. Let me check with our boss.
Angie watched with some interest as he logged into their email account. Preston posted a message about images from the days ride in the dropbox, then asked if there was any reason they couldnt go kayaking in Dinant.
They had a quiet dinner, then went back to check the email again.
Good shots. No reason to avoid Dinant, but not now. Get ready for Roermond. Check the dropbox.
The script spat out a PDF and then a text file. The latter was sort of a cover letter that said at the top, Read the study first.
So they read it, this time in English. They werent surprised the topic was human trafficking, their primary mission. The study explained it as a business, which happened to be illegal. Mostly it was background on what sort of factors affected the trade. Over the past decade, they had gone from coaxing kids to travel alone or in twos and threes to some destination where they were broken and made compliant. This was often the same place they first worked, but someone with a good business sense was trying to make things more efficient. So they began corralling the kids close to where they were found, then confining them in large groups and moving them all at once.
This was what they had witnessed with the bus. Holding them in the bus out in the woods near Aachen, the kids were sold off, but still had to be broken and it wasnt easy convincing them without some force to leave with a pimp. They had tried using tents for the breaking action, but there were too many risks. So the crooks had begun reaching out to other criminal businesses, looking to find better facilities.
The study went on at length, and when they were finished, Angie and Preston discussed how this helped to explain better what they had been doing. Major crime bosses were often spies, too. Spying had gotten expensive and the heroin and weapons trade of days past just didnt pay enough any more, so human trafficking was a new profitable sideline.
Finally, they went back to the cover letter. In essence, it explained that a couple major shipments of kids had come down the Rhine River on barges. Roermond was a city that had long suffered a rather high crime rate, and corruption in the city and district officials didnt help matters. However, the barges would normally have to travel as far north as Nijmegen, then up the Maas canals (south) to Roermond. Whatever the flaws of the very left-wing government in Nijmegen, child welfare was something they pursued with ferocity. After catching a shipment of kids, the officials had made sure barges were checked pretty well. It was quite certain the kids werent going through there any more. Yet, they were ending up in Roermond at a large rural manor near the city where they were broken in large batches.
Preston and Angie were supposed to see if they could figure out how the kids were moved, possibly from Dsseldorf straight west. It was a rather short drive by autobahn to Roermond. The previous use of buses was now too risky, so it had to be some other means. Closing down the breaking house would prove exceptionally tough, but if they could expose who and how they were getting there, it would starve the business for awhile.
Preston sighed. I doubt we can do any serious kayaking on the Maas canal.

Chapter 26
They packed that evening and left before dawn the next morning.
Their hosts at the orchard insisted on Preston and Angie take the camping equipment with them. They spoke unconvincingly of letting them return the gear later. Preston had already found a mountain bike for Angie to match the one he picked up in Margraten. Then he had the mountain bikes fitted with quick-release racks for carrying the baggage. It made them ride differently, but where they were headed it would not be an issue.
Leaving the old city center, they rode across the tracks and wound northward to catch the main route directly into Brunssum. There, it was just a short zigzag to catch the N274 past Schinveld and over the Selfkant. While there had been a good bit of traffic in the morning rush hour, the Selfkant was nearly deserted. The bike path was wide enough for them to ride abreast.
In the quiet, Preston said, Your childhood sorrows are a very expensive but useful asset for me in all this. How much of your experience do you suppose overlaps what these kids are going through?
Angie reached over and gently grabbed Prestons handlebars, slowing them both down. Preston applied the brakes, sensing something very important here. They stopped on the path, still straddling the loaded bikes.
Preston, there is something you dont seem to understand. You still have a very strong emotional reaction to this which is distinctly American. Despite what is published, the Dutch as a whole do not consider child-adult sex a really big deal. Right now, a person above 16 can do anything they like, even make pornography. Between 12 and 16, they can give consent to sex with anybody, and only a parent could possibly complain. Most parents do not. Some of this changed after I became adult, but this is how we do things here.
She looked into his eyes to see his reaction, which amounted to a single raised eyebrow. You know kids in your country do things the same way, but there is only a social pretense that it is wrong and laws very unevenly applied. Here, the pretense is much thinner and thinning more, thanks to stuff like the Martijn Party. But I did not consent to the sex I had as a child. Had the bishop been a loving man, it would have been rather different, but he was cold to us. I seriously doubt our boss and his associates are concerned with molestation itself, but with the use of force. Its like kidnapping and slavery. We have very powerful laws about consent, but the sex itself is another issue entirely.
Angie thought for a moment. I believe the social welfare system in Eastern European countries is quite different than here. It never occurred to us orphan girls to actually run away and stay gone. Even without the sexual abuse, the nuns might be rough with us at times, but the situation as a whole saw very few children fighting the system or running away. These children we are investigating are kidnapped, threatened by people with guns and beaten, maybe starved and even drugged. Whatever spirit of resistance they have dies rather quickly, and the longer the control lasts, it dies more completely. I know from relief work that they often decide they belong to this life in just a few weeks. With drugs, its just a few days.
Preston breathed deeply. Yeah, the whole concept of teenager seems to have been invented in America. I have to wonder what kind of market there is for child prostitutes who are drugged. Genuine pedophiles fantasize about a semi-adult relationship, a child being childish except about this one thing. They believe they can fall in love, and maybe they do. The Dutroux Affair was more like simple prostitution, with torture and snuff films being rather a grotesque extremity. But even then, it would require the kids spend at least part of their days in more or less normal circumstances, maybe leading a double life for the ones not snuffed. I read the testimony of the most vocal victim. For her, sex had to be a game even though she didnt like being forced to play. Its a more voluntary game for adults. Yes, Europeans are more frank and open about sex than Americans, who are socially schizophrenic. I think I get that. But these trafficked kids are all in on this; theres no playing for them. So I rather doubt they are being used in the same market. It would almost require a psychopathic personality to use these kids.
Angie nodded. Perhaps you can ask our boss sometime during this assignment. The study we read said nothing about who the customers are.
They resumed their journey. Once they left the Brunssum area, there were virtually no changes in elevation. Most of the interior Netherlands was flat. Except where a field had been cultivated for a long time, the soil was mostly sand. This was the primary reason for choosing mountain bikes on this trip. There were frequent patches of trees, almost invariably along roads and even minor paths. A significant amount of the forestation was pine, so the sandy soil was packed with needles. The Selfkant felt like a very wide, slight hump in the terrain. Once across it, the ground remained almost entirely flat. The bike paths and field lanes used for bicycles were everywhere, in all directions.
For a time, the highway ran right along the border through villages like Konigsbosch and Echterbosch. Then they entered a tract of forest. Preston decided to cut across country on some of those lanes straight north to Saint Odelienberg. Aside from a friture hardly open that early, they didnt see a single cafe or restaurant, so they stopped a short while on the north side of town and ate some of their packed food.
When they mounted up to ride on, they caught the N293 and promptly crossed the Roer River. It was more of a wide creek, navigable only with small boats. A short time later they passed some industrial properties and ran along the eastern edge of Melick. Where the highway bent around to the northeast, Preston began watching for an exit to the left. This was a new highway that took several hard turns around established suburbs on the southern edge of Roermond. Preston said he wanted to avoid riding the extra distance, and then mentioned he wanted to see the single route into the woods they were allowed to use for the old firing range. He found the new highway had closed off their old route, so he stood looking across the terrain.
On an impulse, he pulled out the fancy cellphone and looked at it. He had yet to try the mapping application. To his surprise, there was a text message from Gary waiting for him. It was the word camping followed by GPS coordinates. Preston had been planning to try several camps listed for the area, so he clicked on the coordinates in the message. The map opened and showed an address not listed in the camping guide. Instead, the map showed a very old rural manor with a moat half way around it.
He had learned not to question Garys messages. Cryptic, obscure and often entirely too terse, they were never wrong. Using the map displayed, he plotted a route to the place. He decided to follow a series of lanes and brick paths provided parallel to the ring road on the eastern side of the city, the A73. Where this highway began turning back west, Preston stopped to double check the maps. They were approaching the new N280 that had been built up above the surrounding terrain and could not be crossed casually. The sides were rough and fenced, with guardrails most of the way. Eventually he decided to continue a ways north to find one of the few underpasses.
This was followed by a fairly long run back down the other side of that highway. Eventually it turned left and struck out across the countryside, leaving the highway behind. About a half kilometer on, the lane ran under the cover of some trees, the promptly came to a T-crossing. Turning left, they were suddenly in front of the ancient manor. Preston double-checked the coordinates and they were right on top of them. The entrance was another hundred meters down the road, but they got a full view of some very well preserved property. On the right were four mailboxes, so they knew it was more than one single household.
By sheer luck they happened on a woman walking their direction from what looked like a barn in the background. As they moved closer to her, the trees parted enough for them to see another farmhouse with at least two different entrances.
Angie approached the woman and asked in Dutch if she knew anything about an arrangement for camping on the property. She asked their names. Upon mention of Forttensie, she smiled and explained how to head toward the back of the enclosure through a covered passage between two buildings. Pointing with her hands, Preston understood she referred to a place behind a tractor barn, on the backside of the building to their left.
Once she was sure Angie understood, she smiled, turned and greeted Preston as Meneer Forttensie and walked into the largest house on their left across the small moat. They mounted their bikes and rode slowly through the stone archway where the woman indicated. To their left behind the last structure was a nice mowed grassy spot. There was a small door set in the build standing open. Preston spotted a primitive toilet inside. He stopped and took a peek in the shadowy room  a toilet and large sink typically used for washing clothes. This was better than some of the accommodations theyd seen elsewhere. Best of all, it was very private and well within riding distance of the entire city.
With lots of bike paths and other recreational features, they would be hard to pick out in a crowd.

Chapter 27
They didnt yet know where the breaking house was, and finding it wouldnt be simple.
Asking questions would likely cause the mission to abort and utterly fail to identify the carriers. They needed to catch the traffic bringing the kids into the area. Some part of them wasnt too eager to know right away. It would have been too painful to think about what was going on inside and too tempting to act rashly and to no good purpose. First, they needed to survey the situation in terms of traffic flow.
They had already seen the main highway running east of there across Germany all the way to Dsseldorf. It would have been less than hours drive in light traffic. This highway ran along the north side of the old RAF Brggen, now Javelin Barracks, where the old Dutch guard had told Preston was some portion of the MPs and civilian administrators that had been at Schinnen. From dim memories, Preston recalled there were small NATO installations all over that part of Germany, over a dozen within a short distance either side of that corridor.
Military traffic must be still exceedingly common in that area. He would be surprised if a significant portion of the personnel at Javelin didnt live right here on this side of the border.
They got their gear set up and made themselves comfortable. The initial ride out from Heerlen was only about thirty kilometers on rather flat terrain, though with a significant load. Preston always carried the lions share, but Angie insisted on doing her part. Once the bikes were unloaded, they removed all but the main rear racks. They would need to go shopping at a minimum, and put light saddlebags on each bike. It was time to get a first feel for this ancient city.
But the ancient city had seen a lot of new construction. Preston noticed the standard online mapping services werent always up to date. As they headed west from the manor, they discovered the new north-south highway had cut off several ancient paths running east and west. They agreed this was different from what they had seen in most of Europe, where new construction accommodated existing routes, even old walking and hiking paths. Here, they were simply cut in two.
On the other hand, once they went around north to a major route that did cross the new highway, they found a brand new and very large shopping center. Even with the longer routing, this was much closer than running all the way into the ancient city center where the other stores were.
Still, they had wanted to do a bit of investigative sightseeing, especially some of the barge havens. They started on the northern edge of what they took to be Roermonds sphere of influence, taking pictures rather frequently.
Some of the havens were clearly industrial and they found a few places where houseboats moored. Yet it seemed the majority was crowded with private pleasure boats; easily half were various kinds of sailing craft. After taking the highway partway across the Maas simply to see it all from elevated position, they turned and headed back down into the old part of city just south of there. Along a very old canal, they stopped for lunch at one of the sidewalk cafes.
The pedestrian traffic was quite heavy, plus dozens of bicycles, a great many parked alongside buildings. Almost all of the bikes were the standard commuter models; their mountain bikes stood out. They decided to chain them to a heavy steel barrier protecting one of the few trees that stood in one of the rare parking areas, taking a small table nearby.
After finishing their meals, they decided to vacate their table for some other customers and picked their way across the busy street to the railing along the old canal. Seeing a stairway leading down close to the water, they descended to the ancient stone dock seldom used these days. At the bottom of the steps they passed a man sitting on the last step, smoking a pipe. Were it not for the fine aromatic smell, they might not have paid him any attention. He was very dark-skinned with Asian features; Preston guessed he was Sri Lanken.
They stepped away to the middle of the dock and were chatting about what they could see. It was readily apparent there wouldnt have been too many options for moving a bunch of kids through any of the normal havens and they wondered how it would have been done. They began lining up camera angles.
This was the time of year one might overhear any number of different languages spoken among tourists on the streets. Apparently the pipe-smoker overheard their conversation and understood it. He approached, and Preston noticed the pipe aroma barely hid a strong body odor. This was not uncommon in Europe in the first place and frankly more so among those from Asian countries. Preston thought the man might actually be living on the streets, because he wore more clothing than even most Asians might for a northern climate, since it was nearly the heat of summer. So while a part of him dreaded the possibility of enduring panhandling, the man addressed their conversation itself.
You know, up the Roer from the Maas are several places where a skiff could easily be pulled up to a paved boat ramp, right next to major streets. If the freight can be moved easily enough, it would be nothing to smuggle just about anything into these parts, especially under the cover of darkness. His accent was surprisingly faint, but carried a hint of the Central Asian sound Preston expected.
Angie was too surprised to speak, simply pulling her red locks away from her face where the wind had blown them. Preston decided to humor the man. You make it sound like youve seen it done a few times, he suggested with a grin.
Done it, the man said proudly. But not recently, and I never trafficked in humans. The damned Euro ruined the smuggling business for me.
Preston countered, Im a little surprised you would be so open about it.
The man grinned. Police here dont use American informants, especially real professional photographers like yourselves. You might be private investigators or reporters, but not police. It was obvious the man was quite observant and had seen a lot.
Preston decided to play along. Okay, so we were curious about reports of human trafficking in the area. Want to say anything about it?
They aint coming off the river these days. Business has been pretty slow these days because Nijmegen has been pretty busy checking everything, not just for children. When cops start looking for something, theyll be glad to arrest you for just about anything else they can find on general principle of not coming away empty-handed. The old mans pipe burned out and he began cleaning it with some small tool he took from a pocket. Thats about the last of good cheap tobacco I was getting.
Preston had seen the prices of the highly taxed tobacco in the Netherlands. Most of it was better quality than Americans usually got, but it wasnt subsidized like coffee. Dutch coffee was the best in the world, and had always been less expensive than the American stuff. Starbucks offered expensive mud compared to what Preston had sampled here in almost every ordinary cafe or snack bar.
Preston had a sudden idea. In your experience, what would be the best way to transport something so the police would ignore it?
Get some other cops to move it for you. They dont mess with each other. The old man grinned, then turned slowly and walked away.

Chapter 28
On the ride back to their campsite, Angie and Preston discussed this idea.
Angie insisted, Corrupt officials are one thing. Local politicians are seldom clean any more than they might be anywhere else in the world. But the Dutch police seldom get too wrapped up in corruption. Gemeentes, maybe. K-Mar  I find it hard to imagine.
Preston came back quickly. Boy, you sure couldnt say that about American federal law enforcement. Theyre some of the biggest criminal operations in the whole country.
He paused a bit. It doesnt seem the Gemeente police would be running back and forth across the border in their official vehicles that much. So that leaves the German Polizei. Thats pretty complicated. We know for certain they have been used a lot in espionage, or at least someone masquerading as them. I know the CIA has lots of friends in the Polizei. Weve already discovered the espionage angle to this child trafficking; thats how we got involved in the first place. But I cant imagine the Polizei would be running across the border too freely, either. So about the only way I can see it is with them doing transfers along the many small routes in the woods. He shook his head slowly. Somehow, that seems entirely too risky and complicated.
But it seems for now thats the most plausible, Angie countered.
Over dinner outside their tent that evening, they scanned the maps of the border area, both paper and online maps. It became obvious that for quite some distance in both directions, the German side of the border was heavily forested. The Dutch side considerably less so, but there was that one area where Preston and his fellow troops used the firing range owned by the Dutch federal police. The next nearest border woodland on the Dutch side was a bit north of where they were camped, just on the south side of Swalmen.
They decided to divide the border region between north and south of the A52, which was the N280 on the Dutch side of the border. This was the major highway route east and west connecting Roermond with Dsseldorf.
The next day saw them angling from their quiet country hiding place down along the back roads to where the highway crossed the border. There was a farm lane connected to a small pedestrian bridge crossing over the autobahn. They turned left off the lightweight bridge onto a narrow bike path. From there they had less than a half-kilometer to the border marked by an almost unbroken tree line on the German side. It was a very pleasant ride and they were hardly the only cyclists on the trails.
On the one hand, the border was shot through with crossings, most of them south of the Javelin Barracks area. On the other hand, Preston could imagine determined traffickers could get a small van down there, but trucks or buses would be nigh impossible. By mid-morning, they decided to head back through the Dutch villages a kilometer or so off the border. There was still the large forested area and they cut it in half by taking the fairly solid lane running past the golf course. By the time they got to Asenray they were ready for a snack. Stopping at the only cafe, they grabbed a vacant table out front and reassessed the task in front of them.
Preston wasnt exactly tired, just feeling a little frustrated. Somehow I get the feeling trying to watch this border area day and night would be way too much. Catching them red-handed seems almost futile. I just dont get that positive feeling about this. Its as if our angels arent in on that idea.
Angie agreed. I think its a dead end, too. It seems too inefficient.
Heading east out of the village, they followed a zigzagging route back to where the little bridge crossed the autobahn. As they rode up over the top, Preston suddenly stopped. He watched a vehicle approach from the east, pass under and cruise off toward the northern end of Roermond. Angie followed his eyes.
It was a UK Military Police car, an Opel station wagon.
Preston looked back at Angie. While his features were nearly blank, he had a very intense look, as if his mind worked furiously. He looked again where the vehicle had gone, then back across the bridge, staring off into space. Angie waited expectantly, but all he said was, Military Police vans.
The ride back to the manor and their tent was silent.

Chapter 29
Preston insisted on climbing into the tent to lie down. Angie knew he wasnt so very tired because they hadnt ridden that far, and certainly not very hard. Lying on his back, he stared up at the interior surface of the tent.
When I was in the Army, the Military Police in Europe always had access to VW vans with the police markings and emergency lights mounted on top, just like the older K-Mar vehicles before they started getting the fancy paint jobs they have now. The US version was dark green with large white patches and big black letters. On the inside, they had a heavy wire cage wall separating the front seats from the passenger area. The sliding side door always had the inside handle removed. It was basically a prisoner transport vehicle with room for six passengers.
Angie finally understood. She lay down next to him. So, we do some night watching, she suggested.
Yep.
Preston couldnt sleep. He tethered the laptop to his cellphone and began researching, looking for images to indicate whether the US MPs still used such vans. Apparently there were still some in service here and there across Europe. Social sites offered photos aplenty. Then he scanned the satellite images of the area.
Without knowing for sure, Im just guessing the car we saw was headed right over here to that new Albert Heijn shopping center. Its probably the closest thing of that sort to Javelin. The next nearest thing is an Aldi out in Brggen, tiny by comparison and not any closer. Theres also the Rheindahlen Complex Preston seemed almost thinking aloud, but Angie understood he was explaining where his mind was going. Without knowing where they might be going or bringing the next load of kids, all we need to do is establish a baseline of routine coming and going by any Military Police vehicles at night across the border.
It seemed to take forever, but finally the sun went down. In the dead of summer, that meant nearly 9PM. They road slowly back to the small bridge passing over the autobahn. Parking their bikes out of sight at the bottom, they didnt climb all the way up. Instead, they sat part way up where they could just see over the side for westbound traffic coming from Germany.
While they waited and watched, Preston and Angie chattered about almost anything simply to occupy their minds and stay wide awake. If I were planning to run small batches of kids into this area, Id want to make sure I had the same vehicles come and go routinely so the local and national police never gave it a thought. Id make sure they came across the border at least once nightly.
He also told stories of apparent corruption he observed or had heard about in the US Army. He became just a bit passionate about it to the point of distraction. It was Angie who recognized the aging VW van with white patches and emergency light bar on top heading toward the bridge where they sat. Preston turned quickly, raised the camera from his lap and immediately began snapping still images. He then stood and made sure to catch the rear license plates.
The camera told him it was pressing midnight. He decided nonetheless to send a text message to his boss, explaining his notion and promising to post a picture of the rear of the MP van with the plates visible into the dropbox.
The next morning Prestons cellphone twittered a reply while he was getting dressed. He snatched it up while still half-naked to see what it said.
Plausible. Plates ambiguous  Rheindahlen or Javelin. See drop.
In Prestons mind, the idea of using a small skiff to transfer from barge to van would explain a lot. Dsseldorf had a great many private havens and several kilometers of beach areas with small roads nearby. Even if an MP van would be conspicuous, other types of cargo vehicles would not. At some point between Dsseldorf and the border was any number of transfer points to switch vehicles. But it would mean someone in the MPs with the means to control and corrupt several others to keep it all quiet. That would hardly be new in the US Army.
Checking the dropbox account, Preston and Angie saw this message:
Youll need to stay around and catch where they take the cargo. No precise location known for the breaking house. Another unintended vacation.
Garys wry sense of humor kept this job sane.

Chapter 30
Of course, it meant a lot of swing-shift work, as Preston called it.
For the next week, at least ten kilometers in all directions, they rode every road, lane and trail they could find. They took pictures of everything conceivably interesting, uploading them every day to the dropbox. Every unusual sight and oddball character they saw was added to the collection. They had memorized the topography in detail. They even went so far as poking around the fence line of Javelin Barracks. While there were some good telephoto shots, nothing offered a clue they could use.
After dark, they were hardly the only people about, even in the countryside. Each night they observed one or two runs by the MP vans. They counted three different plate numbers. So far, they always ran the same pattern: Running the autobahn to the Roermond-Oost exit, and then turning around under the autobahn just a short ways north. They always dropped into the Burger King on the same property as the Albert Heijn, then back out and back to Germany.
Early in that week, though, Preston struck an acquaintance with a K-Mar sergeant he saw coming out of the firing range area. He waved the van to stop. The driver at first seemed only to be humoring him until Preston spoke in his clearly American English. His first comment was to ask if who was responsible for digging the spent bullets out of the sand backstop on the range. The sergeant was riding shotgun and laughed heartily. After Preston explained his previous use of the range, the sergeant seemed quite interested in a conversation. Preston explained he and his wife were professional photographers on a working vacation. They chatted about the old days when Preston was still in uniform.
Eventually the K-Mar had to go, but Preston got his business card with a cellphone number. Later that evening, he tested things by sending a brief text message. He asked if the sergeant would have time for a dinner invitation, and could he suggest a good restaurant for it. The sergeant demurred, but thanked him. Thus began a conversation mostly by text messages about various military news items.
At one point they crossed paths again on one of the main routes when the van pulled past them, and then stopped as they rode up alongside. During the conversation Preston mentioned seeing American MP vans in the area and the sergeant acted as if it was routine burger chasing, a taste of home.
Preston and Angie had begun to despair of seeing anything different. Perching somewhere different every night, they watched with decreasing enthusiasm. On their eighth night, the van turned off the N280 heading south on the A73 ring road. They lost it of course, but decided to keep heading along the parallel road. It was just a hunch, but they rode up onto the highest overpass overlooking the area where Preston and his associates used to turn into the woods to get to the firing range.
Just at that moment, another MP van passed under and ran down the newest highway laid through the area. His eyes followed the lights far down in the quiet night, while Angie trained the camera on it. She strained to track the vehicle, but the tall trees standing alongside the road hid them after a few moments. They rode as quickly as possible along the same route and somewhat beyond where they had last seen the taillights. They were now on the north edge of Herkenbosch following the N570. To their surprise, yet another MP van roared past them, turning off on a country lane. The taillights remained visible against the tree line across the fields for quite some distance.
Again they strove to chase it as far as they could. Some distance down this small lane running east, they eventually spotted headlights coming at them. Sure enough, it was one of the vans running in the opposite direction. They knew they had to be very close to the turn-around point where the vans had gone. From previous exploration they knew this wooded area stood just north of a sprawling camping park filled with little trailer houses. These were all pretty much identical, owned by the park management and rented to visitors. In the woods were some carved trees of various mythical figures from Dutch and German fairy tales.
Just ahead, another vehicle came out of the woods on the left. They ducked down a side path and waited, carefully noting where the van had emerged from the woods. Once it was past, they rode hastily to the spot and just past it. Dragging their bikes into the woods, they laid them in the underbrush and began creeping through the gloom toward a lighted area. It was fenced and screened by thick hedges. They were just tall enough to prevent Preston seeing anything but the roof and eaves of a long, low building. There was the noise of some activity and quiet voices.
Preston quietly grabbed Angie, stood her back to him and lifted her on his shoulders. She understood immediately and sat upright just enough and took a short video of what she saw. She tapped him on top of the head and they fled as if their lives depended on it. They continued up the same road to avoid being seen by the last MP van leaving. Just a few hundred meters took them to a bike route running the border back to the highway they had been watching all this time.
It was no surprise they spotted one of the vans heading back into Germany as they rode alongside the autobahn to their small overpass.

Chapter 31
It was an all-nighter.
They processed the videos and still images of the vans they had managed to capture that night. The prize was the footage Angie shot over the hedge. The images offered a clear visual of the MP driving the van and someone standing next to the vehicle. The building was an ancient horse barn with multiple outer doors. It was quite extensive. There was a small human sized door in the middle, and it was next to this that the van stood idling as the MP got back into it and drove off. The other person walked back into this personnel door and closed it behind himself.
They worked feverishly but with precision. Toward dawn they were nearly finished, having posted the camera files and a written summary. It bothered Preston they didnt catch any images of what was in the vans. Still, all three vans in one night making a trip to the hidden horse barn and back out was obviously not part of their military routine. If it were, the K-Mar would know.
It occurred to Preston that this might interest his friend in the K-Mar. First, he needed to confer with his boss. Waiting until dawn, he took the initiative to make a voice call to Gary. To his surprise, the phone was answered immediately.
Great stuff! Gary sounded wide-awake.
Preston decided not to ask why, but got right to the point. We dont have direct evidence of the cargo. Would it be against policy to contact someone in the K-Mar with our evidence? If we are on target here, that horse barn is full of young guests who would much rather be enjoying the childrens park right next door.
Yes, do that. Tell them youd like to watch from a distance and see if you can get footage of that, too. I can verify your press credentials if necessary.
Im going to text him right now, so stand by and Ill let you know. Preston tapped the disconnect and did what he said.
Interested in catching some child traffickers? I think Ive found a nest.
While it was quite early, and he only waited an hour or so, it seemed to take forever. Prestons cellphone rang with a voice call.
The sergeant said with just a trace of humor, I rather expected you were up to something. Please explain.
Preston summarized some of what he knew, pretending to be an investigative reporter.
The sergeant responded, We knew it was around here, but never could catch any movements because we didnt expect such a carrier. Ill pick you up in a quarter hour.
Preston didnt get a chance to explain that he wouldnt leave Angie out of it. When the K-Mar van showed up, it took only a little arguing to force the issue. He promised Angie would do only what he told her to, and insisted on keeping her close for her own safety. The sergeant yielded that point and they squeezed into the back seat with a couple of other officers.
On the way, the sergeant spoke into the police radio once or twice, but it was abbreviated jargon Preston couldnt follow. They rolled to a stop, and then turned onto the bike path just short of their intended target. Everyone dismounted and the sergeant barked a few commands. They had Preston walk them through the woods in the general direction of the place. The three officers spread out a bit as each tested his radio quietly against the vehicle radio where the sergeant remained. It was only a couple hundred meters into the woods. The thick thorny hedge went all the way around. A bit of poking showed there was an old horse fence inside it. The officer got some scratches on the arm for his trouble.
It was quite some ways around the perimeter of this thing. Preston raised his camera overhead a few times to catch images of what was inside the hedge. It was just a standard horse barn with stall openings on both sides. There was a large square barn on one end, but no other buildings. The officer with Preston and Angie said something in his handset neither of them understood. A couple of brief responses came back, then the sergeants voice last of all. In the distance, the vans engine started again and could be heard approaching on the road. In the daylight, they had seen there was a swinging gate set into the hedge on the side facing the road. The driveway zigzagged a bit so that the trees and underbrush hid even the gate from direct view from the road.
The van pulled up to the gate and the horn sounded quite loud in the morning stillness. Preston had moved around to the front, estimating the same location as the night before. He held his camera up just high enough to aim over the hedge, and then had Angie stand behind him to view the display panel as best she could. Someone eventually came out to the gate, but apparently refused to open it. Preston thought he heard the Dutch word for warrant  huiszoekingsbevel  in the discussion. The sergeant shrugged, stepped back to his vehicle and chatted on the radio a bit.
This time Preston understood the gist of the conversation audible over the handset of the officer nearest him. In essence, someone on the other end had gotten a warrant already. It required the presence of some local official to execute the search, so the sergeant simply waited with his officers scattered around the perimeter for about another fifteen minutes. Then Preston could hear the approach of more than one vehicle. It turned out there were two vans loaded with K-Mar and the official. With the official standing at his side, the sergeant shouted through the gate at the building, then produced a pair of bolt cutters and cut the chain. He swung the gate open.
It was almost anti-climactic. Preston re-positioned himself with Angie to record the whole thing. The vans rolled into the parking area in front; the sergeant knocked on the door. No response. Four officers pulled a heavy metal ram from the back of their vehicle. There was one more shout from the sergeant through the door, and then he stepped back.
It took only a few whacks and door gave. Everyone drew their weapons and entered the building. While inside, a bus pulled up on the road out front and blocked the drive. It was escorted by a Rijkspolitie van. These blocked the road and kept back the gathering crowd of onlookers from the campground and passing cyclists and hikers.
The K-Mar escorted out four men and two women, cuffed and placed inside various vans. Next came a line of kids of both sexes and varying ages, seemingly starting around eight years, followed by the local official. It was no real excitement for Angie and Preston, just the tapering end to a long tale. Or rather, it was one of the few good endings to an ongoing horror.

Chapter 32
Preston noticed a local news car showed up just in time to video the departure of everyone but the sergeant and his original crew.
He and Angie did their best to hide from the reporters and their camera. The sergeant seemed to understand and allowed them to get back into the van. They sat in the back and watched until another crew came and relieved him to take them back to their campsite. When the other officers appeared to be staying, Angie and Preston moved to the middle seats for the ride back.
The sergeant said, We saved this group of children for now. Maybe they will do well. But you know the same madmen who wanted their bodies will simply find more.
Preston and Angie were silent. Eventually Preston asked, I dont suppose you know who the customers are.
The sergeant smirked. You dont want to know.
I know the Israelis are in on this, with the possible complicity of the CIA and other national spying agencies, Preston offered.
The sergeant turned to glance at Preston sitting behind him. You know too much. He drove in silence a moment. Okay, so maybe you could guess for yourself, but most of the trade ends up serving in places where NATO, the UN and EU government bodies meet and their branch offices. Most of these kids would end up near The Hague, but working for different pimps scattered around the area. My understanding is the pimps all work together in a loose confederation. This is a very loose but very large organization. You can guess the rest.
Again, it was anti-climactic.
As they drew in sight of the Albert Heijn shopping center, the sergeant said as if to no one in particular. You know, Roermond is a rough city. You have friends here, but your enemies are quite dangerous. Its probably very wise to pack and ride out away from here right away. Catch the train. Maybe ride it north to Venlo and back over to Eindhoven or something.
The sergeant had avoided the highway, taking the secondary main routes instead. So driving north of the shopping center, he crossed under the autobahn and kept heading in a northerly direction. A bit short of Swalmen he turned and drove back down into Boukoul. He said something about not even trusting his own fellow officers too awfully much, and then pulled up on a side street where a narrow graveled lane dropped south into the woods. Its just a short distance from here that way. He pointed down the bike path.
Angie and Preston already knew it came out just a few meters from where they were staying. They understood. This was the nature of their business.
They had already half packed before leaving, so getting things loaded on the bikes took less than an hour. Using it as a hint, they followed the same route back up into Swalmen. A train heading north came along shortly. At Venlo they had to change trains, but almost at random decided to head off into the German side, ending up with one change in Mnchengladbach. With only a short wait, they caught another train south to Herzogenrath. It was a bit longer there, and the ride into Heerlen was actually shorter than the layover.
Preston stayed awake while Angie dozed curled up against him. He couldnt have slept if he wanted. They were back at Heerlen Central shortly before dinner. Exhausted, they eventually fell into bed rather early and slept late.
While Angie went about making breakfast, Preston passed everything on to his boss. Over the next few days, they processed the footage and photos for cataloging. Eventually Gary sent an email.
One real MP, two impostors, working out of Rheindahlen. Cargo picked up at differing beaches in Dsseldorf parks, moved from the barges by skiff as you suggested. Vans decommissioned now. Final destination you were told is confirmed. Now you know why this is so hard.
Angie and Preston went to the Prancratius Church the next morning for Sunday worship.

Chapter 33
As they were moving out with the line of worshipers when the service ended, a young priest beckoned to them. They turned and followed him to one side of the entryway. He turned to face them with a gentle smile.
Preston was mildly surprised the man chose to address them in a very precise Dutch-flavored English. Victory is not in what we win, but in our willingness to continue the battle until we die. Please dont stop what you are doing. You brighten the light this world needs to see.
With tears in her eyes, Angie stepped forward and took the priest by the hand and kissed it, and then hugged him. Preston settled for a warm handshake. Somehow, it seemed proper to copy the way Hendrik and Gary had done, using both hands.
As they turned to leave, the priest added, Dont be strangers. Our angels are all friends, so we should be, as well.
Indeed, there were angels everywhere, it seemed.

Part 3  Of Truth and Angels

Chapter 34
Things had slowed down a bit for Preston and Angie.
They were ready for that. It was good for them to have a period of adjustment without crises to force the sudden definition and redefinition of priorities in life. It was time to think about things.
It was also time to consider a regular fitness program. Both of them had been operating on the strength of previous fitness efforts, but as part of their overall search for a norm, a baseline from which to operate, they felt the need to regain some control. But the private gyms were didnt feel right. Angie was not used to creating her own guided program, having simply taken advantage of whatever training was included in the various sports in which she had participated. So it fell to Preston to come up with something for them until a better idea came along.
In their explorations and photography forays, they had stumbled across several playgrounds with substantial equipment. They concentrated on those closest to the vast Brunssumerheide, creating workout routines on them. While recent years had seen a lot industrial scraping in parts of it of the heath, there was still plenty of greenery left over and Prestons memory from twenty years earlier served well. He and Angie established a pattern of mixing upper body exercises on the playgrounds with running in the sandy hills of the heath.
The ride out from Heerlen served as a good warm-up, and it was a decent cool down in the ride back. True to his promise, Preston began adding training in Taekwando. Not that he was really up to par himself, but he used what he could remember. Angie picked up on it quickly, despite her misgivings about the idea of violence. They had several weeks to settle into this routine.
That was largely because their hopes for kayaking in Dinant were squelched by an extended summer drought. There were a number of volksmarches that Preston felt were worth the effort simply to see the countryside. It gave them a chance to see places like Malmedy, Namur and Bastogne. Until further notice, they continued avoiding Liege and Masstricht as advised earlier that summer. But in general, while they were culturally more comfortable among the Flemish, it was the accident of history and geography that placed the most beautiful hiking areas in the hands of the Walloons.
During one of their hikes, Angie decided it was a good time to broach a question that had been tumbling around in the back of her mind. This work we do is personal for me. At the same time, Im highly motivated to work with you whatever it is you are doing. What drives you in this work?
Before he could answer, she went on. I know you just sort of stumbled into it. I was there. But you seemed to have a mission in your soul already, just waiting for a chance to do something like this.
Preston grinned. We dont often talk philosophy and religion because our instincts are the same on most things.
He slowed a moment to pet a friendly dog someone was leading on the trail. They moved on as the dog decided to stop for a nature call.
I went to one kind of church or another for most of my life. Even while I was stationed here, I went to chapel pretty regularly. Back when it was called AFCENT Chapel, the staff would organize an annual retreat at Rolduc Abbey down in Kerkrade. One year we had a speaker who was an Iraqi pastor. Hardly anti-American, he was trying to get the message out that Christians in Iraq were badly hurt by American military activities. There was a lot of political posturing about having him speak to American troops so soon after Desert Storm. They wouldnt let him come to the chapel, so we had to go outside the system to see him, but something told me to ignore all that crap and go.
He was silent for a few minutes while they took an arduous climb up a hill. At the top, when he caught his breath, Preston continued.
There werent very many of us there at that retreat, so it was very informal and much more interesting. The man spent a lot of time talking about seeing the world from a non-Western viewpoint. One of the first things he said was, Christianity began as an Eastern religion. Then he went on to make the point that you cant really understand the Bible unless you understand that Eastern point of view. Not like Hindu or Shinto Eastern, but Middle Eastern before Islam. So I did some reading. Most of it I didnt really understand, but some of it must have leaked into my head, because it changed everything.
They stopped to admire the view from a cliff overlooking a small river valley.
American religion in particular is deeply afraid of anything outside the tight control of the conscious mind. Almost the entire field of evangelical religion is too cerebral, and that isnt what we see in the New Testament. That has its place, but it should serve, not lead.
Angie reminded him, The Catholic Church has a wide range of different traditions feeding into it. In the positions I held it was easy to see a lot of infighting behind the scenes, but somehow things manage to keep going. Still, there is more than one grand tradition of mysticism. We have eastern churches I heard about only a little, so I cant pin it down between east and west. Some of it was like psychobabble, but some of it seemed quite powerful.
Preston nodded. If you rely too much on emotion, youre just an animal. If you rely too much on intellect, youre just a smart animal. If you learn to listen to something higher, you at least have a chance to get involved in whats really worthwhile. People who deny that there is anything higher cant even be called Christian in my book. Even after those papers we read and the work weve already done, I dont pretend to understand this business all that well. But inside of me is a very quiet, very hot fire, and it wont let me ignore this problem. We already know we arent saving more than maybe ten percent of the kids caught in this mess, but theres something in how we do this, something about simply exposing it, that seems to answer that fiery demand on my soul.
They agreed it was something strong enough to keep them focused until the next episode.

Chapter 35
In Belgium generally, and Walloon areas in particular, there were numerous little shrines, field crosses, chapels and so forth.
Some were quite artistic. A few were frankly disappointing, consisting of little more than a cheap plastic bottle from which the holy water of places like Banneaux had been already drained. The bottle was molded in the shape of any number of famous statues of Mary. Other shrines were dedicated to various saints. Prestons interest was measured. The artwork was pretty and he took seriously the strong feelings people attached to such things.
However, it was plain to Angie that Preston shared little of those feelings. She remarked, Most non-Catholics arent really into it, I know. Besides, its not all that popular in the Netherlands. Maybe you know we have a large rebel Catholic community based in Utrecht called Old Catholic Church. They dont venerate Mary or the Pope so much.
They were walking past a collection of icons planted permanently alongside a narrow lane, representing the Stations of the Cross. Angie had stopped at each, was quiet for a moment, and then moved on. Their conversation came and went between the stations.
Preston noted, I remember seeing some posters and signs about that in Utrecht. For me, theres more to it than that. Obviously, Americans have little of the history available here in Europe. Half of these shrines are older than the United States. Youve still got Roman Roads in places where weve marched. On top of that, we have a cultural revulsion to anything that smacks of feudalism and privilege. But in my own case, its no longer a simple matter of reflex. Im not hostile to the veneration of Mary, but I cant go there because of very strong convictions based on what Ive learned about spiritual matters.
Angie responded, I know you have always been polite about my devotions. Had you asked me a year ago, I would have certainly said I expect men and women to argue. Thats so common here in Europe, like an unwritten law. Americans have big noises about feminist politics, but here those politics have ruled for a long time. You never said, but I know you dont agree with much of feminism.
With a half grin, he noted, And you seem to be okay with it. Im not much on arguing and debating. I trust in God and simply obey what I know He demands of me. Feminism is wrong because its native to Western Civilization, which is also pretty messed up. The whole thing is based on a completely false set of assumptions. I gave up trying to teach people a long time ago. I just walk in the light I have and let God worry about the details. For whatever reason, you have found yourself at home with my choices.
She nodded with a firm expression of agreement. Yes. I dont know what it is, but it seems to work. I can tell when you dont like something, but you just let it go. Its like you know Im going to run into trouble with it, but even if I dont, maybe it does no good to argue.
Preston shook his head. We have too much else to worry about for me to pick at everything I dont like. But youll notice I take full authority on some things and dont make room for argument. Thats conscious.
She grinned. Yeah, but not for me. When you do that, it seems everything in me gets kind of quiet. I never met anyone like you before. She put an arm around his waist and hugged him.
He responded in kind, grasping her around the shoulder. For me, it doesnt matter what you believe about Mary. I dont care about the theology and mythology, if you will. What bothers me most is the tightly entangled feminism that comes in the package. When devotion to Mary gets in the way of serving her Son, it makes me uncomfortable. I dont agree with folks who say its the same thing. Her Son was a Hebrew man, a very masculine culture. But a masculinity totally different from the European brand or the American brand. When devotion to Mary comes off like heathen idolatry, and especially when it becomes the excuse for perverting what the Bible teaches through these unconscious cultural assumptions about Gods Creation, I get a little unhappy. Since I often cant explain it without people getting hysterical, I just back off and try to stay on course with my own devotion to God.
After a few moments, he added, You do what you have to do to keep a clear conscience. So will I. As long as we can negotiate the differences, we belong together.
At that, she stopped him and fully embraced him with a firm kiss.
They decided not to antagonize the young priest at Pancratius Kerk over such things, and simply accepted him as a supporter, at least, of the association that employed them. They seldom saw him outside of Sunday worship, but did run into him one evening at the local Pizza Hut.
As they sat together enjoying the uniquely Dutch flavored American franchise offerings of Italian food, the priest made it a point to apologize to Angie for past abuses by the church. She didnt query how much he knew of her past, but the controversy over revelations that Dutch priests and nuns had abused children was still a warm, if not hot, item in the news. Then he changed to topic.
Ive been praying for rain. Im not so worried about it here in our water-soaked lowlands, but for the Belgian highlands. It would add so much to your next journey.
Angie and Preston glanced at each other in puzzlement. Was he that much inside the association?
The priest went on. Its highly unusual, but I wanted to confer with you about something coming up in the next few weeks. He paused at the look on their faces. Yes, I know Gary and Henk. Most of us are constrained in ways you two are not. Perhaps it would amuse you to know what a large number of people in odd places are relying on you for things weve often longed to do ourselves, but just could not afford the risks of losing all our advantages.
Preston offered, We knew a long time ago not to poke at whats behind the curtain. We arent mercenary about the pay, but as long as everything keeps working out and our few contacts seem happy with the results, we plan to stay at this.
The priest smiled. You make this too easy for me. Gary wants to meet with you down near Dinant. As I understand it, youll be doing something we believe is more typical of our operations. At the same time, it will add a dimension previously not possible. He pulled out a pad of sticky notes and peeled off the top sheet. Sticking it down on the tabletop, he produced a pen from another pocket. Actually, it was a very fine-point pencil, Preston noticed.
After scribbling a bit, the priest pulled it up off the surface of the table and handed it to Angie. Again, dont lose heart. He smiled warmly, then slid out of his seat and left, dodging through the crowd of the busy pizzeria.
On the note was an address in Weillen, Belgium.

Chapter 36
There was also a date, three days from then.
Preston and Angie had reduced virtually all communications to electronic means. For their pay packets, they decided to set up regular mail retrieval through the PostNL office nearest their apartment. Everything came addressed Poste Restante (General Delivery) in their alternative names and they checked weekly to ensure the personnel got used to seeing them. Their pay came twice each month, typically in the form of currency, but was postmarked from all over the Benelux. Aside from a handful of advertisement fliers, nothing was ever pushed through the mail slot in their door.
Until the day after the priest gave them their next assignment, that is. When they returned from their regular workout the next day, there was a fat padded envelope on the floor just about the size for shipping a cheap paperback novel. It bore the marks of some obscure private courier service.
Preston and Angie were justifiably nervous about it, but upon slowly opening it, they found a small, nondescript box of single-wall cardboard. It bore a lone adhesive mailing label from their ostensible employer in Luxembourg City. Inside were two thin packets with French labeling and a cover letter wrapped around some currency. The letter was something dashed off on a computer in a decorative, oversize font.
No camping or bikes this time. Need casual dress, swim and athletic attire. Dont bother your hosts. See the old barn out back.
Angie translated the writing on the packets  hair-coloring kits, including the means to wash it out.
Preston looked at one of them. I can see doing this to disguise your beautiful red mane, but Im a little puzzled about mine. Preston had allowed his hair to grow back out and kept a trimmed full beard. The instructions covered how to darken beards, too.
It would mean slipping out of their apartment before dawn to avoid being noticed with their different coloring. They decided for this trip to simply pack everything in normal duffel bags that had straps allowing them to be worn like backpacks. On the appointed day, it was just a short hike to the train station. There was an early express through Masstricht into Liege. This left just a short layover in Liege for a departure farther along the Meuse to Namur where they waited briefly for their train to Dinant. It was during this segment they each slipped into a toilet and changed from casual to hiking wear. Because these were such important rail links, it wasnt too far from the scheduled times. They arrived mid-morning at the station.
It was pretty easy to find a TEC bus running close to their destination. They found it a fairly short and refreshing hike up along a stream, mostly through the woods to the north of the village. Near the crest of the terrain was a clearing on the left side of the road. At the far edge of this stood a very old stone farmhouse. The address was the one they had been given. They looked the place over from the road and noticed a narrow graveled track running around the north side of the house.
The place was very quiet and they were understandably nervous about it. Around back was indeed an old barn, mostly of stone but apparently patched at some point with bricks. On the far side was a small door set deep into the brickwork. On it hung a tiny brown envelope with a rubber band through a hole punched in to top. Inside was the key to a padlock on the door. They opened it slowly and looked inside.
The ceiling was high, but the rafters slung low. It was clean and free of cobwebs. The interior space was only a few meters across and somewhat farther in depth. A single small window on the left, somewhat dirty, let in a little light. Across from the window on the interior wall was a double sink with a high arched spigot. The plumbing was mounted on the wall in plain sight. Beyond the sink was a toilet with the typical old European style high-mounted water tank up inside the rafters. On the nearer side of the sink was an old zinc-coated, slope-sided watering tank, just big enough to use as a bath. Both the sink and tub drained into an open channel cut into the floor and disappearing under the interior wall.
Opposite this on the wall with the small window was an ancient desk with two metal folding chairs. They had paint splattered on them from long ago, but were still serviceable. What drew their attention most was the hammock. The mesh was woven from strands that were quite thick. Slung on the high end from a rafter beam and tied on the low end to an upright post, it was over a meter across with sturdy spreader bars and the mesh was covered with a rather thin mattress. Angie walked over to the bed and squeezed the mattress; federbett she announced in German.
She turned to Preston with a smile. This should be interesting.
Preston grinned. Just getting into it would be some work. Lets see if we can work this out.
With practice, they decided for the most part that Preston had to get into it first. He was just shy of six feet and substantial, though not burly. That the hammock was tied close to the gather at the top helped dampen the swinging a bit when they shifted in it. Preston glanced up and expressed a bit of surprise that the wooden framing didnt creak under the weight of their small movements. They rested a moment and he noticed the desk had a single lamp plugged into a double outlet, the only power visible in the place. In the corner nearest the door was an old hanger rack with the built-in hangers, perhaps a dozen or so.
This is really a classy accommodation, he noted.
Turning to look around, Angie spotted something on the desk. It was a simple matter to roll off the side and she went to see what it was. After reading it a moment, she held it up for Preston to see. Ticket for a kayak tomorrow morning! She was clearly excited.
Thats because it had rained starting that night after they met with the priest for pizza. In the Dutch flatlands, it was a continuous moderate mist for the past three days, but in the Belgian highlands, Preston had noticed it was a heavier rain. It was just tapering off during their hike up the road from the bus stop. This virtually guaranteed La Lesse would be up to a good depth for their run down it tomorrow.
For now, it was close to lunchtime. There was no kind of wifi anywhere close. Preston tethered to the cellphone and found a decent signal. Between the tourist information maps online and the bike map they had picked up in Monschau, they discovered that the only eatery nearby was to the northwest. It wasnt a long or unpleasant hike, just not what they expected. They were so very close to a major hub of tourist attractions, yet very nearly isolated in the Belgian highlands not far from the French border. The actual city of Dinant was something like seven kilometers away, mostly a straight line once they got back downhill into the village.
The tiny cafe in Falan was quite adequate for a surprise lunch. The menu was available in several languages, but Preston let Angie do the talking. They also ordered something they could carry back and have for dinner later. They traded off carrying the bag as they looked around the picturesque village and took a few photos. Then they trudged back to their hideaway.

Chapter 37
They were ready bright and early the next morning to catch the bus down in the village.
There was a simple connection to another line in the south that ran all the way to the head of the kayak run in Houyet. They were hardly alone among the passengers with the same destination, but the morning was still cool and the crowds would not come until later. With the recent rains, the stream was a bit swollen and fast, perfect for this time of year. The only problem was finding the particular vendor who had issued the ticket, as there were several, each with their own color of kayaks. It was easy to find the guys who rented out the red ones and yellow ones, stacked on tall racks all over the place. They eventually found one with blue and white boats that matched the name on the ticket.
Their ticket included the deluxe paddles and a relatively fancy two-seater. Preston knew from experience that he had to sit in the rear. They were launched from a roller track that ran down into the water. It wasnt all that different from his experience canoeing in the Boy Scouts back in the States. For the first kilometer or so, he talked Angie through keeping the thing aimed down stream and away from obstacles and other kayaks.
They really werent that far into the trip when they saw him. There were a handful of serious kayakers who rode their own equipment, and Gary was one of them. They were facing a tight turn to the left and he called to them from the shadows on the right. There was a tiny stream feeding into the main flow, running out from under a small wooden footbridge up on the bank. Gary had tied up his orange and black boat to a small but solid tree on the bank facing outward. He extended his line for Angie to tie off on the loop at the bow of their boat. This made for an odd water-borne conference with him facing them both.
Glad to see you didnt waste any daylight, he started off. Angie, if I really wanted to threaten Preston, what do you think I would do?
She glanced back at Preston behind her and blurted out, You would attack me. Preston nodded agreement.
Gary grinned. You two are an amazing team. Your level of trust is quite rare in this world. Yet people intending evil are forced to use the same means to their ends. They have to rely on people they can trust on some level. Preston, you helped run a business during the worst of the off-shoring days in the US. How did you stay competitive?
Preston felt he knew where some of this was going. Without hesitation, Well, fleet maintenance is pretty hard to do offshore, but a couple of companies tried to bring in foreign workers. We beat them on service. Parts are parts and we were all pretty much restricted to using the same basic equipment with so many suppliers closing shop. But the big thing for us was keeping our people happy and motivated to do better work for the money.
Gary laughed. Key word there  people instead of personnel. That says it all. It was the same in the Army, wasnt it?
Preston shook his head, It would have been if the system hadnt promoted bean counters over genuine leaders. I dare say some units I saw, the soldiers might not be too convinced their own superiors werent the enemy.
Gary nodded. Even bad guys know that. They might be willing to use fear, coercion and slavery, but there have to be a few insiders who run interference for them. A big shot working on his own has to run himself ragged in micromanagement. Smart bosses always find good people and divide up the workload.
He took a deep breath and waved at some random passing girls hooting at him. Kids, he snorted. You two dont look too bad in your dark hair. For this mission you arent likely to see too many trafficking victims. In a few days there will be what I call a mini-Bilderberg meeting here in Dinant  politicians, business and labor leaders, big investors, and so forth. As you might expect, at least half of them are mere figureheads. We arent too concerned with the big shots. We need to know about their lieutenants.
Gary shifted in his kayak and pulled on the rope a bit. The paparazzi will be here, too. Did you ever work with them, Preston?
Preston had, indeed, tried early on to get work with the freelance news photographers, but decided that was the wrong field of operations for him. That was a cluster, he snorted.
Gary continued, In a crowd of photographers at a media event, how many are actually working for their sponsors? Dont you find some of them always willing to haggle with the competing interests? Preston nodded as Gary went on. Yeah, and theres always a few who actually work for the people they pretend to photograph. Again Preston nodded.
Gary turned to Angie, Can you spot a photographer who isnt really a photographer?
I think so, she said with some curiosity in her eyes.
Gary leaned back a bit in cockpit of his kayak. Dont shoot pictures or video of the big shots. Shoot everyone but them. This thing should take a few days, so youll get plenty of time to figure out who is always there, who is playing maitre d for the people who get in the news. We are about to publish some big scandalous splash to shake things up, and we need to know whos doing the real dirty work. Nobody else in the association has the time and energy to work this on the ground, nor anywhere near your talents  not to mention the obvious protection of God. You two are walking miracles. Dont fling a needless challenge in His face, but dont be afraid to keep His angels busy if thats what the situation requires. Also, dont stop anywhere and tie up your boat and leave it today. Someone will trade you for their less deluxe accommodations while your back is turned.
Without another word, he turned and released the line holding them all in place and slipped past them into the river.
Angie grabbed the line and pulled the slack end into their kayak. They turned and drifted back out into the mainstream. Gary was already a distant speck, zipping down the river ahead of them in his custom fitted kayak. They focused on enjoying the scenery. At places the bank rose up steeply to stone cliffs. There were a couple of fancy chteaus right on the water.
Preston remembered a warning he read in one review: Somewhere beyond the halfway point was a dam with a sluice. When riding down the sluice, it was critical to line up straight and off on the right side, and then stay to the right and paddle quickly to avoid getting caught in the folks dawdling at the bottom to watch others. The right side was a little deeper and most of those who hung around drifted toward the left where it was shallow.
They managed to clear the sluice without getting overturned. It had become quite warm and they removed their light jackets. At the end, the worker on the reception dock directed them to reverse the kayak, point the bow back upstream, and then sidle over to the quay. Strong hands helped them climb out and took control of the kayak. All they had to do was walk away.
It was impossible to avoid getting pretty wet during the run downstream, both from splashing by others and by water running off their paddles. But after glancing into the shower facility and seeing it was unisex with both genders running around nude, Preston glanced at Angie. Not my scene, Babe.
Mine neither, she assured him as they strolled toward the main street. They had already begun to dry and were quite hungry for lunch. Angie suggested they not grab the first one near the kayak endpoint, but walk out toward the gorgeous cathedral on the main road. The tourists were already out in force, and they drifted across the bridge eastward over La Lesse and along the street until they spotted a cafe with signs suggesting it was a baker-butcher shop. It seemed the right place at the right time, so they turned in there and picked out some sandwiches and a pair of what Belgians called chocobollen  a flaky light popover filled with a rich pudding-like cream that wasnt too sweet, then dipped in chocolate icing. The coffee was superb, as it usually was in these parts.
Preston was describing a few volksmarches he had made in the area during his first stay in the Benelux. Dinant had become one of his favorite destinations, especially the Two Forts March that took walkers upriver on one bank to Givet, France, and then back down the other bank. He mentioned there were lots of trails in the area not on the bike maps.
Show me, Angie challenged him.

Chapter 38
While the kayak trip had made their shoulders and arms sore, their legs were itching for a workout.
After lunch and a potty break, they struck out for some exploration. Backtracking a short distance, Preston turned off to the left up a steep ramp. It was an established walking path with railings and asphalt paving. Atop the ridge, the paths went in several directions, but after glancing at the map, Preston led the way up higher on the ridge. The small country lane opened onto ordinary open farm fields, but rather well kept. Instead, it was the road that was rough. Still, it was a pleasant view.
Preston pointed to the cell tower on the right. Might get a good signal up here, he clowned. Cell service was notoriously bad in the Walloon highlands. Ahead a ways was a sharp left. They could hear the sound of heavy highway traffic nearby, and Preston showed her on the map where they were going to cross just under the N97 autobahn. Within a half-kilometer, the path ran past a farm house and into the woods. A short distance later took them under the autobahn and into a recreational area. There were trails and stony open areas all over the place.
They managed to pick out a few thin trails that led them down into the next valley northward. Preston stopped at the road and pondered a bit, scanning up and down the road to orient himself. I cant remember that well, but from the terrain, Im guessing its uphill there. He pointed up the valley. On their left was a long row of townhouses with no break for quite some distance, aside from tiny narrow passageways.
Eventually it opened to reveal some really ancient houses and well kept gardens, nestled up against the trees that concealed a very steep hillside. On the right the dense forest and brush barely hid an even steeper rise. Eventually a few shallow buildings managed to squeeze themselves into the narrow space along the road on that side. Some of the structures were ancient stonework with tiny shrubs growing from the interstices between the stones. Preston kept scanning to the left and eventually stopped where the road turned hard right. There was a break between a small yard with a wooden fence on one side, and a gravel drive running up to an opulent house behind some trees on the other side. A track ran up the hill where some recent tree harvest had left the ground bare.
After walking around a bit in the inevitable mud left by the logging, Preston spotted a thin trail running up one side of a narrow draw. The trail rambled upward in more or less the same direction until it hit the rocky brow of the hill. There were signs where other feet had sought a break, and they eventually found it. Passing between two rocks they scrambled up some thickly layered decaying vegetation onto another, fairly solid but narrow trail running behind the rocky lip. Preston turned left, back toward the Meuse valley.
There was still a good bit of picking their way among the rocks, but they found a place where the tree line opened onto an unfenced field. There was a broad track running along the narrow opening in the trees back toward some houses and agricultural structures. Eventually they were ushered into a narrow lane running among some very nice houses, some new and some ancient, but all every well kept. On their left was a rare barbed-wire fence backed by a row of very tall pine trees. This continued straight up the hill and to a crossing at the crest.
They turned left and headed down-slope between a stonewalled barn on the left and a more ancient stone fence along the right. The walls gave way to high hedges and newer structures, after which they turned right and headed down an increasingly narrowed lane that ended at stone gate posts. To the right was a rugged walking trail. After a short run through some trees, they found themselves in a mixed rocky and wooded area that had seen a lot of hikers. The primary path wound down onto one of the few streets dropping off the ridge into the backside of Dinant. Preston turned back uphill a few meters to yet another path.
It was coming back to him in bits and pieces, but with the help of the map, they following the narrow rocky tree line between the open private farmland and the bluff. They ended up just above the ancient citadel.
Angie turned and asked in a childish tone, Are we there yet? Then she laughed.
Preston turned and said, One more little goody, then we take a break and go back to our vacation quarters. After looking over the fancy garden at the citadel entrance, they went back out past the hotel and turned left down into the woods. I promise you, this journey is almost through, he offered.
Nobodys whining, she answered tartly, then grinned.
The trail dumped them out onto a long winding street headed back down into town. It was pretty easy and at the bottom they encountered one of the giant saxophone monuments to its inventor, Adolphe Sax, whose house was nearby. Just beyond this, they turned left down a narrow street named after Sax, running between tall buildings. The houses quickly turned into shops, and then a few cafes began appearing. They decided it had been a long enough hike to justify another meal. They passed a tiny Sicilian cafe and the aroma was too much. Heaping plates of pasta made them forget some of their soreness.
They loitered and emptied a bottle of wine between them. Though tired, there was one more stop they wanted to make, and it required a hike back north along the riverfront. Dinant had restaurants and cafes aplenty, but actual grocery stores were thinly spread. They were growing tired of restaurant food. The nearest grocer from where they were was just over a half-kilometer.
Angie picked out some items that needed no cooking. Upon leaving the grocery market, they decided to cross the Meuse on the walking bridge atop the lock. It wasnt much of a drop in the river, but barge traffic demanded such controls at long intervals on this part of the Meuse. A little over a half-kilometer south and upriver on the west bank brought them to the transportation hub. The wait for a bus was long, and they decided to spring for the expense of a taxi.
The driver was chatty, but Preston and Angie preferred to let him rattle on with minimal response. They were thinking hard about their hardest assignment yet.

Chapter 39
They entered their hideaway and Preston took off his fanny pack, turned and dropped sideways across the hammock. Angie removed her pack and took his from the floor, moving to the desk to open them.
Darlin, I really love sleeping on this thing but it narrows our choices for other activities. He turned his head back around and grinned at her.
She leaned over and put her finger on his lips, shushing him. Then she replaced her finger with her own lips, kissing him upside down. We have work before pleasure. Come help me catalog these images.
The cell signal was poor that evening, so nothing got shipped. They planned to carry the laptop down to see if the city offered enough wifi signal for the necessary traffic. Preston was quite sure there would be something in the dropbox, since they had nothing to indicate any schedule of events for the confab starting the day after next.
The next morning bright and early they walked down into the village, and then followed the small road straight east toward Dinant. It was just over ninety minutes of brisk hiking to where the road began seriously descending down over the lip of the Meuse Valley. There were a couple of hairpin turns, bringing them right in front of the boarding school that Francophones referred to as collge before it offered a turn back down toward the main bridge. Preston decided to follow a hunch and chased the road farther south to the N936. He turned sharply left back down the hill a bit, then right at the overpass for the railroad tracks. Where the road sloped up toward the lip of the valley, about halfway to the converted monastery that was now a hotel, he stopped.
Preston pointed out they had direct line of sight across the river, down the narrow lane to the front of the Hall of Justice. That building was built tightly against the gray stone bluff. He checked it through the newer camera and zoomed in for a good, clear view of the entrance. He looked up behind him and noticed it was possible to climb up on the rocky embankment that had been cut for the road. Farther up near the hotel the slope was easy enough to clamber up. From there it was a simple matter of walking back along the higher point of view to the same line of sight. It was a beautiful shot, and Angie took a turn looking at it through the camera.
They went back down the road into town and crossed the bridge. This placed them back in the open square next to the cathedral, and at the foot of the stairs up to the citadel. A couple of the cafes were offering a decent breakfast, and they decided it would give Preston a chance to begin scanning some of the hotels and other places likely to offer wifi. His hand held wifi channel receiver hadnt offered much so far.
One cafe not yet open had a signal too weak from that distance. After breakfast, they wandered south along the river. Most of the signals were encrypted, but up near the Ibis Hotel it got strong. The casino next door had a great open signal. Sitting on the walkway along the river was possible, but there was terrace cafe service there for coffee, so Preston felt it was only fair. Besides, the coffee smelled too good.
Once connected to the Net, they managed to exchange the images and videos taken so far. And sure enough, the dropbox contained a PDF with the itinerary for the three-day conference. There was also an appendix:
Dont worry about the chteau where they are staying. We have a couple of friends there. Try to catch the limousines where they park and who hangs around them, and be sure to catch the river ride.
They noticed the schedule started with meeting the first day in the Hall of Justice, then a private hotel conference room on the outskirts of the city. The second day was a deluxe barge ride upriver and back, projected to run until mid-afternoon. In his mind, Preston saw lots of police and paparazzi boats escorting them.
Angie asked him, Are we going to use that spot on the hillside to watch them unload the limos?
That would be cool only if we need to catch the big shots with telephoto, but Id rather be in place to see where the limos go from there. Cant be that many places to park a bunch of big cars all in one spot.
They studied a detailed city map they found and noticed the streets were almost all one-way in that part of town. Preston noted, If we can bank on the cops sticking with the simplest plan, that would mean pulling up in front of the Hall of Justice up that narrow street, unloading, and then turning left toward the cathedral. So when they start arriving, well post ourselves on the plaza and see where the first one goes and take it from there. I rather doubt theyll all come at once, for security reasons. If they are staggered out enough, well have some time to get an idea where to start looking. Ill bet they dont go far.
For the next few hours, they referred to the agenda and walked around, trying to estimate where the paparazzi and other onlookers would cluster. They found out the citadel would still be open, and expected a few to use that high angle view. Preston doubted there would be any helicopters or other aircraft, though. He joked about camera drones with the private and police ones crashing into each other or dog fighting.
As they stood on the bridge, leaning on the railing and gazing upriver, Angie asked seriously, What if someone figures out what we are doing and takes exception. Could we be arrested?
Preston thought for a moment. Turning his head, he met her eyes. Somehow, I doubt it. Well be two out of hundreds of people using cameras. Even if someone gets upset at our behavior, they would have a hard time convincing the police to come after us. Its more likely theyll try to come after us themselves.
She wrinkled up her mouth, twisting one side up without amusement. I was afraid you would say that.

Chapter 40
By lunchtime the spectators began showing up.
That is, lots of cameramen were scattering across the city looking for advantageous locations, lots of people in expensive suits despite the late summer heat and a few extra policemen in groups talking and pointing. Angie and Preston agreed they would now miss having their bikes. Up to this moment, things had been fine, but with so few crossing bridges and the long stretches between landmarks, the bikes could be really useful. On the other hand, this was setting up to be an even more crowded place than even the worst of normal tourist traffic.
So the next morning they put on their business casual attire and left early so they could take their time. The regular bus schedule was disrupted and they decided to simply walk back into town while it was still relatively cool. A cluster of photographers already setting things up and competing for the best spot occupied the hillside with a good view that Preston had found. Preston pretended to do a slow panorama but only recorded while aimed at the cameramen and their activity.
At the bottom of the hill on the traffic circle stood, of all things, a shawarma cart. Angie and Preston agreed it was the perfect quick breakfast, and they werent alone. The river was extra busy with small motor boats all over the place. A few had cameras mounted on poles or small towers. Meanwhile, a flat bed truck was dropping temporary traffic control equipment to groups of workers and the occasional policeman. Preston and Angie decided to hide in the throng already gathering on and around the bridge.
They had plenty to do working to spot and shoot various people too well dressed for ordinary work or tourism. From time to time they would trade the cameras back and forth for one purpose or another. As the buzz of police motorcycles and patrol cars increased upriver near the gauntlet running into the Hall of Justice, they watched closely to see mostly local officials and opulent cars, but no limos. Preston and Angie worked their way slowly toward the east end of the bridge.
It was two hours before the first limo came. In the lead were the motor officers forcing serious impediments off the N95, followed by the actual motorcycle escort just in front of the oversize car, zipping along and up to the entrance of the gauntlet. Barriers were moved to allow smooth passing, and then quickly put back in place. This got the crowds attention and bodies everywhere surged a bit in renewed activity, yet strangely having no real effect on the actual crowding itself. Preston and Angie positioned themselves to watch the departure, which they expected to run back out heading north along the one-way street pattern because of the movable barricades on the plaza. The N95 was split: Southbound was along the waters edge, while northbound was a block inland. The open plaza at the west end of the bridge afforded a good view from a wide range of locations. They stood against the northern bridge railing, where the southbound half of the highway ran under the bridge and along the quay on the eastern bank of the Meuse.
The first limo delayed longer than they expected at the Hall of Justice, making them wonder if their guessing was all wrong. Eventually it was led slowly past on the northbound lane as police struggled to clear the pedestrians. Preston and Angie crossed the open area to watch where the limo went. A ways down it turned right, at what should have been the long climbing N936. They decided to start moving in that direction. It was a long interval before the next limo whizzed by, so they had already begun the long climb that they had come down just two days ago. Before they managed to get as far as the small trail they had taken down from the citadel, another pair of limos passed together. Preston noted, I have a hunch theyre parking somewhere near the citadel. So when they came to the path climbing up through the woods, it seemed a natural choice.
They stopped where the path turned to give them a clear view across the open field, leaving them still rather obscured in the woods. A couple of batches of hikers passed, one group in each direction. The limos came into view just seconds later, heading down the drive to the citadel parking area. Preston backed up a bit and found a track running through the woods, keeping them in the tree line while winding around to the backside of the parking lot. They eventually got where they could see that the police had cordoned off the section of the gravel parking area just along the trees. The limos were being lined up rather like a funeral cortege. They decided to continue watching from the woods for awhile, recording video of the activity around the big cars.
Its Gordy! Preston exclaimed in a loud whisper.
Who is Gordy?
They both kept their eyes and cameras trained on the activity. Gordon J. Bishop. Back when I was in the military, we had a cluster of serious college basketball fans in my unit. There was one player the mentioned who had enough size and strength, and pretty athletic, too, but he never seemed to find his niche. For a few games he was a busy guard, the next a hatchet man... Angie could see a dark-skinned man considerably taller than the others people milling around the limos. Among the players, he was only average height, still pretty tall, though. He was drafted kind of low, didnt adjust well to the pros, and finally ended up playing on some team here in Belgium.
One of the odd things to Americans visiting Belgium was the Wallonian obsession with basketball. Every tiny village had at least one basketball goal mounted somewhere in an open area. There was as much basketball as there was soccer. Somewhere out around Spa in the Ardennes, Preston once stumbled on a tiny hilltop village where the central open plaza was one big circle. Around the whole perimeter were at least a dozen basketball goals and some of them seemed busy almost any time of the year. At some point, the Belgian professional ball clubs began drafting pro players from the US who couldnt make the cut back home. For awhile it was so common that the English-speaking international schools in Belgium always had a few kids whose dads were professional basketball players from America.
Preston explained, Apparently he never really got comfortable playing here, either. He dropped off the radar. He always was a thug; hed make the perfect fixer.
Whats a fixer? Not a repairman of any kind, I assume. Is he a bodyguard? Angie asked.
No, more like chief thug. Its not so much doing physical violence as threatening it, along with other ugly consequences. They take a high paycheck for the high probability of being arrested on a regular basis, keeping their boss out of trouble. It keeps the lawyers busy, too, but remains an essential part of dirty business.
They held their location in the trees until sometime after two dozen limos had pulled into two lines and things slowed down a bit. Angie was looking through the back of the small camera at the activity off to the right, near the gate leading into the citadel, when Preston said, Uh-oh.
She lowered the camera and turned to see someone walking straight toward their position. At about the same time, there was some noise off to their left from the direction they came. They quickly stuffed their cameras into their fanny packs and started looking for a way of escape. It was pretty thick underbrush to the right and behind, but they began pushing that way. The bluff wasnt quite so terribly steep here and Preston whispered something about avoiding any ledges. Part of the rock formation formed a wall that forced them down-slope. Somehow, they ended up facing a fence about three meters above the street, but somewhat close to the roof of a building. It was ancient stonework, and Preston guessed it was one of the shrines, squeezed between a business and the sheer stone bluff.
The noise in the brush above them continued, though no pursuit was yet visible. Were out of options, Babe. Preston climbed the chain-link fence and lowered himself down to the clay-tiled roof. Angie came right behind him. They clambered down the slope and Preston took advantage of the wire mesh tightly clinging to the rock face, designed to prevent loose rocks from falling. He engaged in a little impromptu assisted rock climbing to get down. Angie was a good bit better at it. While a few onlookers in the open square there expressed a little surprise, no one seemed too excited. That is, except for the sound of cursing voices above and still out of sight.
Still, the adventure had roughed up their hands, and Preston began digging for their little first aid kit as they walked quickly away across the busy square and past the Sicilian cafe they had enjoyed just the other day. Next to it was a narrow cut between the buildings, which led them back down to the busy quayside. They were daubing antiseptic on their cuts as they walked.
Thats enough adventure for one day. Lets go back to our dark lair, Babe, Preston suggested as if bored. Once across the bridge, they stopped just long enough to grab some carryout from a friture and hurried up the hill, across the tracks, followed by a sharp right up the hill toward the boarding school. The long hike back was uneventful.
We need to remember to carry gloves, Angie said looking at her hands. Prestons were worse because the same amount of skin bore a heavier load on his hands.

Chapter 41
I think its time to remove this hair coloring, Preston suggested as they started filling the tub.
He looked at the small on-demand water heater common in most of Europe. This has to be the smallest one they could find. They had to turn down the flow a bit or it passed through too quickly to be warmed much. Preston decided it was also time for another hair cropping. Angie was glad to help, having already declared a preference for the shorter look on Preston.
They rolled into the hammock that night looking very much like their passport photos again.
The work of processing the images and videos had never been so hard, and with only one computer at that. They reviewed their results again the next morning. Aside from Gordy, they picked out about three dozen people they felt were most likely candidates for attention from the association. Preston loaded a selection of images on his cellphone for quick reference, using humorous pseudonyms for those they couldnt actually place with a name.
On a hunch, Preston suggested that they pre-pack their stuff. Then they put on hats and left their hideaway north bound. A narrow track eventually brought them onto a slender paved road leading into a village. They passed through along the main route eastward. On the eastern end of the village stood a very old monument that served as the bus stop where they caught a ride down into the northern end of Dinant. Only as they left did they find a sign pointing back into the village with a name: Sommire.
They had donned for the day their hiking gear and broad-brimmed hats against the summer sun. With sunglasses, they both appeared completely different from the previous day, aside from their relative sizes. The bus turned right onto the main route and chugged up a slight incline, stopping to let them off next to a large parking area. At one end was a low, narrow arched passage under the railroad tracks, letting them onto a paved walking path along the riverbank. At the water gate they took the walking bridge across and found themselves almost in front of the grocery shop. They wandered over to where the tourists clustered on the north end of a large parking area just off the riverbank.
A large tree offered shade at the entrance to a tiny round building. Through the windows, it looked like a library or information booth. Angie and Preston rested a few minutes, discussing their plans for the day.
What would you bet they moved the limo parking for today? Preston offered.
You would win, Angie countered.
There were far more boats than usual, including several with police markings.
Maybe we can squeeze into the crowds on the bridge again, she suggested.
They eventually wandered over to a sandwich deli and got some ham and egg sandwiches with coffee to go. They strolled slowly back toward the walking bridge over the canal lock, eating as they went. Both times across, the lock was pretty busy, as was the pedestrian traffic, so catching the narrow walkway over one gate or another took some patience. They strode slowly along the quayside toward the main bridge in Dinant. They engaged in plenty of lallygagging and acting like tourists.
Space on the main bridge was at a premium. Eventually, Preston handed Angie the better camera and hoisted her up on his shoulders. This worked well enough, giving her a better line of sight over the crowd. The pleasure boats had already tied up just south of the bridge. One was obviously the center of all the attention, very fancy with multiple decks. The other was slightly less opulent, but receiving no less attention. It was this second one that Angie focused on the most, while Preston scanned for interesting photographers.
This time the limos were closer together, in three convoys with the usual police motorcycle escorts. With all the boats crowding the water, there wasnt all that much water visible to the casual observer. Preston had no trouble recognizing Gordy. When he realized Gordy had not boarded with the rest of everyones entourage, it made him a little nervous. It was the final excuse he needed to bring Angie down and head west off the bridge. Preston glanced back a few times but lost sight of Gordy, despite the mans height.
They went back the way they had come and sat on the west bank itself for awhile, feet hanging down on a grassy slope that dropped quickly to the water. They reviewed the footage and still shots for quite some time, matching faces to their previous list. Preston made note of a few new faces. He decided to upload everything via his cellphone broadband connection.
When it appeared things had settled back to a less intense pitch on the other side of the river, they wandered back over the bridge. There were a couple of cafes featuring live music, so they tried to pass the time. They ate some lunch and wandered around a bit, never getting too far from the open plaza near the bridge. As it got warmer, they shed the outer shirts, exposing matching gray tank tops underneath. They rolled up the t-shirts and stuffed them in their fanny packs.
Eventually some of the smaller boats began to return. Cameramen were disembarking and vying for good shots to catch the barges approaching from upriver. The police boats cleared some space against the quay, while the officers on the shore started blocking traffic. It seemed the conferees were going to disembark and walk up the street to the Hall of Justice again.
Meanwhile, the entourage boat edged against the quay first and tied up. The well-dressed occupants got off quickly and swarmed the quay where the fancier boat approached. Preston decided to tether his camera this time and stream the footage live to their upload link. It was downright hot, so the crowd wasnt quite as thick this time. Preston was hoping he and Angie could get some footage with both cameras without bringing attention to themselves by her riding his shoulders again. They managed to get some very good line of sight on the entourage.
Once the VIPs disappeared down the gauntlet toward the Hall of Justice, and the supporting staff thinned out, Preston walked over to the last of the huge stone flowerpots sitting on the walkway at the east end of the bridge, on the northern side. He was holding the camera down where they both could see it. They were discussing quietly who was visible.
Suddenly Angie was shoved roughly aside, off the walkway and into the street, where she fell on one knee, the other leg splayed out to catch her from going face down.

Chapter 42
From behind, large brown hands grabbed Preston, lifting him slightly off the ground.
Purely by instinct, Preston simultaneous thrust the camera out at arms length while kicking where he thought the legs should be on whoever grappled with him from behind. The next instant he was bent over with a huge weight pressing him down as one hand reached for the camera. Preston knew instantly that the arms were covered in the fancy suit he had seen Gordy wearing that morning.
Even the best trained fighters were seldom as skillful in combat as they hoped. Preston was barely keeping the camera from the grasping hands. His hat was gone and forgotten. They must have spun around two or three times. Things happened too quickly for him to tell.
Meanwhile, Angie recovered. For just an instant she watched in pain and horror as the dark-skinned giant wrestled with Preston. Suddenly she felt anger, as if all the things ever done wrong to her boiled over all at once. Worst of all, this brute was attacking her man, a capital offense in her world. She could have ripped his head off with teeth and claws if necessary. Hardly conscious of her actions, she simply acted on pure fury. Sprinting a couple of steps toward the flowerpot, she jumped up, planting her left foot smartly on the edge. She wasnt sure what to do next, but getting up closer to the mans head seemed an obvious necessity.
At that moment, Preston realized Gordys face was behind his head. He pushed back, and then snapped his head forward and backward again with all his might. The crown of his head connected to something not entirely hard. Suddenly the grip on him loosened just a bit. He had planned to spin around and add an elbow strike, but the man had backed off out of reach, standing almost upright, with one hand instinctively rising to touch his face where the mouth and nose began bleeding profusely. The attempt still spun Preston around.
It was at this instant that Angie launched herself at Gordy. She drew her feet up together and stomped at him with all she had. Her right foot impacted on the joint between his chest and left shoulder. The left foot hit him full in the sternum, driving his tie tack through the fabric and into his flesh. Already stunned from the hard head-butt to his face, he rose up full length and flailed his arms, trying to keep his balance as he back-pedaled.
Preston was already turned and instinctively caught Angie as she rebounded from the impact with Gordy. They watched for the split second that it took to see him back forcefully into the railing. On most folks, it was almost chest high, but for Gordy it was just below waist level. Instead of arresting his backward momentum, the high aluminum bar only redirected it. His hands continued arcing back over his head and he flipped over the railing. His body managed to somersault once completely, landing him flat on his back with a very loud smack into the murky water of the Meuse.
Instinctively, Preston grabbed Angies hand as they sprinted off the bridge. There was only a slight hesitation as they dodged between two vehicles where they crossed the street. Glancing back, Preston saw a couple more nicely dressed men behind them. Straight ahead was the foot of the ancient stairway up the bluff to the citadel.
Neither he nor Angie hesitated. The entrance to the cable car ride was packed and spilling into their path. They managed to dodge through without hitting anyone and began sprinting, two steps at a time, threading past the tourists not nearly so hurried on the steps. With Prestons hand pulling her, Angie was able to match his giant strides. Some part of Prestons mind realized this moment alone justified all those times they had sprinted up the sandy hills of the Brunssumerheide for the past few weeks, repeating it until he nearly puked. He was just a bit faster on the hills than Angie, but she could repeat it more times. With such a lazy morning so far, they had plenty of energy to spare this time.
A bit of yelling behind them signaled the necessity of driving ahead full speed. Apparently none of those in pursuit were in any kind of shape at all. At the top of the first long run, Preston turned to glance back as the well dressed men were struggling to merely walk up the steps quite some distance behind. Preston whipped out his camera and took a quick shot of them, then grabbed Angie and sprinted up the next section. They hit the landing two-thirds of the way up, and without slowing, sprinted around the crowded photographers there and up the final run in the opposite direction. The men in fancy suits had either stopped or were simply too far behind to have any hope of catching them.
Preston got a couple more shots and followed Angie inside the fort. They climbed the interior stairs at a slower pace, and then entered the interior courtyard. With so very many tourists and photographers already crowding the place, they simply bypassed the shops and ticket window and walked out the arched tunnel on the far end. They found out how to get out of the place. Hesitatingly they approached the gateway up the terraces, scanning to see if they recognized any trouble ahead. There were no suits and no limos in the parking lot.
They walked at a good hiking pace, already recovering their breath from the run up those four-hundred-plus steps. It was a short walk to the trails and Preston led the way off to the right. Just a short way into the woods, Preston pulled Angie off the trail to one side. He fished out his first aid kit and began dressing her skinned knee. Its a good thing you were on my side. Poor Gordy never had a chance.
Angie nearly collapsed with laughter. Preston kept working as best he could. Then she recovered and asked, Did he hurt you?
Just some bruises and sore spots. Lost my hat, but he apparently didnt damage the camera any. Even if he had, it wouldnt have done him any good. We had uploaded it all and I was live streaming at the time. He didnt even unplug it from the tether. I did that when we got inside the fort.
In essence they retraced their hike in the opposite direction from the day they had taken the kayak ride. There were a lot more hikers, so they were never quite alone this time.
After crossing La Lesse, they went farther upriver to another set of sluice gates and lock. This was a very broad path zigzagging over an island in the river. Only the part where they crossed the actual gate was narrow. Here the Meuse bent hard around, the far bank ran east and west. Just a short hike downstream toward the city brought them to a low underpass on one set of railroad tracks, then up a narrow lane where a trail permitted them to cross another set of tracks. They were careful to avoid touching any metal parts because this one was electrified, with heavy cables overhead suspended by metal and concrete frames. In the trees on the far side was a trail. Quite steep in places and slippery, they eventually gained the high ground next to the autobahn. There was a grassy cut through the trees along the south side of this all the way down to a farm road running into the backside of a village called Onhaye.
Passing through, they stayed on the small lanes and woodland paths, coming around behind their erstwhile quarters.
It had been a long and beautiful hike, and it was time to go home.

Chapter 43
Grabbing their bags, they made sure to check that everything was as they had found it. Returning the key to the tiny enveloped, they hung it on the door handle, closed the lock on the hasp and strode off into the woods.
They had taken longer volksmarches, some lasting all day. Somehow, this felt like more work. Still, it was more beautiful woodland, hills and valleys. They found their way to the village of Foy. Once again, they wished they could have brought their bikes. Not because hiking was so hard, but they had entered a valley in which the railroad line had long ago been turned into a paved bike route. Instead, they had some dinner at the cafe that also served as bus stop. Eventually a TEC bus came along to take them back down into the Meuse Valley. On the way, they chuckled about passing the chteau where most of the conferees had been staying.
The bus took them northward into Yvoir and stopped just a couple hundred meters from the train station. In the gathering darkness, they caught a train northward toward Namur. It was quite late when they got home in Heerlen.
They woke up early and worked hard with their minds the next two days while their bodies rested and healed. Over the next week they read with some amusement the stories appearing in various media outlets. Some of the stories hit only the tabloids. Preston knew that sometimes the truth is so shocking that no sane person is going to believe it. The whole thing had a cascade effect as the Belgian government collapsed again as it did so often. Election time again.
The links to the stories were passed to them via the email account. In the middle of this, Preston found a message in the dropbox.
Gordy hospitalized and one other with heart trouble from over-exertion. Check out the fall volksmarching in Germany. The Benelux could use the rest.
Garys dry sense of humor never failed, nor did the angels or the truth.

Epilogue
Angie and Preston had a rather quiet fall season volksmarching in the Eifel, Rheinland and Saarland areas.
During a beautiful hike in Trier, they stopped for a snack on the university campus. While they sat enjoying Bavarian pretzels, Prestons phone rang.
Garys voice was the same casual tone, but he never called for frivolous reasons. We think its time to recruit in the Liege-Maastricht corridor. Are you game?
Preston asked, Are we moving again or do you have something else in mind?
It would be great if you could set up shop there somewhere, but Im having trouble finding safe quarters. Who would have thought a real estate attorney would fail to find something decent?
Preston caught Angies eye while he spoke into the phone. You know, Ive been thinking about this. I may have a useful solution. Can I get back with you in say, a week or so? I may have to wear out this phone.
Im game, Gary said.
It was only two weeks later Preston and Angie took possession of a lovely used Dutch houseboat. It took some calls to get access to his accounts in the secretive Caribbean bank, but he had more than enough to buy the boat outright. He worked through his friend Harry, of course. For good measure, he added a slender canoe, mounted on the stern for easy access. There arent many places in the Benelux where a canal doesnt run within a few hours of biking or canoeing.
They picked up the boat where it was moored along the Molendijk in Krimpen aan de Lek. They hired a professional pilot to train them as they journeyed slowly upriver on the Neder Rijn. The pilot left it to them in Arnhem. Through connecting canals, they made their way to Nijmegen and up the Mass. They celebrated their first Christmas together in Maastricht.
There had been dozens of boats for sale as winter began to descend over the land. They never told anyone, but the primary reason they picked this particular boat was a small image, the common European conception of an angel holding an anchor, painted on the stern next to the name: Waterwings.
