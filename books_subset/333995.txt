Authors Note

Many cultural traditions include a flood myth in which a deity or deities send a great flood to destroy the earth and all humankind; the biblical story of Noah and the Ark is one of the most famous of these stories. While the tale of Noahs Ark is, at its heart, a metaphorical one, I have chosen to retell the story as realistically as possible.
Most biblical scholars agree that the flood would have taken place around 2300 BCE, during the Early Bronze Age. While there is less agreement about the location of Noah and his family prior to the flood, I have chosen to set the story in what is now Turkeyspecifically, the region of Turkey known as Eastern Anatoliafor two reasons. First, according to the Bible, the Ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat, which many scholars believe to refer to Mount Ararat, a dormant volcanic cone located in Eastern Anatolia. In addition, two of the rivers described in the Bible as flowing out of Eden, the Tigris and Euphrates, have their source in Eastern Anatolia. Therefore, its reasonable to assume that some of Adam and Eves descendants, including Noah, might have settled in the region.
In my story, both Noah and his son Shem are bronze smiths; as bronze tools were essential to the peoples livelihood during the Bronze Age, Noah and Shems profession would have earned them a powerful status in their village. Readers may also be interested to learn that early bronze smiths worked with an alloy of copper and arsenic rather than copper and tin, and over time, many smiths developed arsenic poisoning. Arsenic poisoning can cause both physical tremors like the ones Noah experiences in his hands, and mental confusion and delirium.
Readers might also wonder why Noah and his family dont observe Jewish traditions such as honoring the Sabbath and following kosher dietary laws. Most religious scholars date the origin of Judaism to around 1800 BCE, when Abraham denounced the worship of idols; a more organized version of Judaism developed around 1300 BCE, when Moses received the Ten Commandments. My heroine Neima and the rest of her village, living around 2300 BCE, would most likely have practiced some form of multi-god and goddess worship. Archaeological excavations of Bronze Age Turkish sites such as Alacahyk have uncovered goddess figures and deer and bull figurines that may have represented deities. Noahs conviction that only one God existed would probably have seemed strange and unseemly to Neima and her family. Overall, as I was most interested in the human relationships behind the flood story, I chose not to focus on Neimas and the other villagers religious beliefs before the flood arrived.
Readers may also have questions about the animal species that are and arent present on the ark. Working on the assumption that Noah would have believed the animals he knew of to comprise all the species in the worldor at least the only ones he could reasonably get hold ofI chose to include only animals native to Turkey on the ark. As a result there are no African animals such as zebras, giraffes, hippos, rhinos, and monkeys on my version of the ark. A more well-traveled trader, like the one Neima befriends, might have seen the rhinoceroses and monkeys he describes to her in India or even Africa. And to answer the many horse, dog and cat-loving readers who might be wondering why those animals arent on the ark: while these animals may have been domesticated prior to or during the Bronze Age in various parts of the world, I could find no definitive evidence that they existed in Turkey around 2300 BCE, so I chose not to include them. Smaller wildcats such as the lynx, however, do appear on the ark in my novel.
While Ive done my best to root my novel within a realistic historical framework, Neimas Ark is ultimately a work of imagination. All errors are my own.
Noah and His Descendants




Part One: Before the Rain

The Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And the Lord regretted that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved Him to his Heart. So the Lord said, I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the land, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens, for I am sorry that I have made them.

--Genesis 6:5-7

Chapter One

My grandfather is a madman, and the entire village knows it.
Weve watched the skeleton of his madness rise from the ground, bones and joints of wood fastened together until theyve grown higher than the tallest cedar tree in our valley and longer than all the cottages of our village placed end to end. As each gap in the skeleton is filled with more wood, weve watched his insanity gain flesh, becoming a solid, hulking beast that looms above us. It is an ark, two sides sloping down to a rounded base, like the coracles that carry fishermen down the river bordering our village. But my grandfather Noahs ark is broader than the river at its widest point, even when the waters swell at the height of the rainy season, and I cannot imagine a body of water large enough to hold it aloft.
We watch the sun rise over the arks peaked roof every morning, and now, as I carry a basket of soiled laundry to the river, I watch the ark grow larger before me. It sits on the far side of the river, just outside the village border, where the villagers cant rightly complain about its presence. Though they do so regardless. I move closer still, juggling the basket that threatens to spill shifts and shirts and shawls with every step I take, until I can make out the outlines of the men standing atop its deck. Most are hired men, nomads who will work for grain or livestock, pottery or tools, but one of those men is my grandfather Noah. Two of them are my uncles. And one is my father.
Now that the arks construction is complete, Noah has ordered my uncles, my father and all the laborers he can find to coat the ships surface with pitch. The black, sticky stuff has crept its way up the wood with each passing day, until only the open deck and the rectangular, slant-roofed structure atop it remain uncovered. And worst of all, the pitchs stink has woven its way through the village, noxious and smoky and oily, coating the insides of our noses and throats with each breath.
It is no longer enough for us to witness Noahs madness; now we must smell it as well.
Neima! Its a young voice, just behind me. Male.
I clutch the basket handles tighter, frozen in my tracks now, not ready to turn toward my pursuer. Not one of the village boys come to harass me again, to pluck at my skirts or tip my basket into the dirt. Not today. Its too hot, the air too thick and foul, and I cant take it. I should ignore their taunts, walk fast and keep my back straight, but my curiosity gets the best of me. I turn my head
and breathe a sigh of relief when I see its only Jorin. Reliefand annoyance. Jorin is always following behind someone or other, like a lost lamb scampering after the flock. He even sounds like a lamb, his voice high and bleating and
Neima. You dropped this.
Im perplexed to find my body still frozen as he approaches, one of my linen shifts in his outstretched hand. Its Jorin, all rightbut when did his voice grow so much deeper, so strong and assured? I blink, shake my head, wondering if Im seeing thingsbut no, a new width broadens his shoulders, and he stands nearly a hands breadth above me, though we are the same age and have always been the same height. How did so much change without my realizing it? Jorin is no longer a boy, and I can no longer compare him to a lamb.
Well? He holds the shift just out of my reach, crumples it in his dirt-stained hand, waves it from side to side. Do you want it or not? Ive been thinking our goat needs a dress. She shivers at night, and she would look quite becoming in your
Surely your goat would be offended by my simple garment, I say, reaching for the fabric with one hand. Only when I let go of the basket do I realize Ive been gripping the handle hard enough to rub my skin raw. You should raid my aunt Zedas laundry insteadher clothes are much finer. But youre not brave enough for that, are you? Jorin lowers his head, avoiding my eyes as he finally hands back my shift. I thought not, I say, a touch of victory in my voice.
Jorin may not be a boy any longer, but he has a long way to go before I will call him a man.
I turn once more, walking faster toward the river. Jorin scrambles ahead, swivels to face me, and lopes along backward so the morning sun frames his form. All the men in our village have dark hair, but Jorins always grows lighter in the summer months, and even now, more than a moon since the harvest ended, his hair shines the same bright bronze as the carving knife my father made for me.
I shake my head again, as though I can cast out that ridiculous thought. What is wrong with me today?
Youre not angry with me, are you, Neima? His eyes widen, and I glimpse motes of gold dancing within the brown. Not that I can blame you for being out of temper this morning. That pitch smells worse than the shit of a hundred hogs
Jorin!
He falls quiet and turns, allowing me to lead again, but he continues to trail me. Finally I must ask: Dont you have work of your own to do?
Ive fed all the animals already, he says, and I want to rest my feet in the river.
If only we all had time to rest our feet, I say, although truthfully I am looking forward to the cool water as well. The rainy season is late in coming this year, and the dry heat that sucks moisture from the air, from our skin, from our very bones has lasted so long I sometimes forget what it feels like to be cool, to pass a day without my dry throat aching and the dust rising in clouds around my calloused feet. I walk faster, anticipating the first gasp of chilly river water against my skin; but then I spot the gaggle of squealing, half-naked children coming our way. They arent watching where theyre going, and one boy nearly collides with us. That is, until he realizes just who hes approachingNoahs granddaughterand trips over himself in his hurry to shift course. He even yelps, and when some object falls from his hand, he doesnt stop to pick it up.
Then I see what the boy has dropped, and his fear no longer bothers me so much.
Its a scrap of cedar wood, twice the length of my hand and thicker than my thumb, neatly sawed at both ends. A remnant from the ark. After a quick glance around to make sure no ones watching, I rest my basket on the ground and pick it up, caressing the planed wood, smooth as river stone.
The boys are still daring each other to bring home the cursed wood from the ark, I suppose, Jorin says with disdain in his voice.
Dont be so superior. I keep my voice light. I seem to remember you doing the same, just a year or two ago.
Jorin scowls, kicks a clod of dirt free with his bare foot. No, he says. I might have fetched the wood, on a dare. But I never believed those foolish superstitions. I always brought the wood all the way home. Or to you.
I blush at the reminder that Jorin is the only member of our village, besides my parents, who knows my secret: I carve miniatures out of wood. Animals and people, cottages and coracles, carts and wagons, all small enough to fit in the palm of my hand. It is a strange hobby, especially for a girl, and Mother was not happy when Father taught me and even gave me a carving knife of my own. She forbade me to speak of my craft or to do it outside our cottageNoahs behavior brings enough attention to our family without my adding to itbut Jorin once ran into our kitchen during a rainstorm and caught me whittling before the fire.
Even now, out here where anyone can see, I cant resist running my fingers over the wood for a moment, feeling the warmth it holds inside after a morning in the sun. I wonder what creature lies beneath the smooth surface, waiting to be freed by my carving knife. But then I shake my mind free of its daydreams, tuck the wood under my laundry, and continue toward the river. I have work to do.
Jorin has never revealed my strange secret, but he often asks what Im working on and if he can see it. I can sense the usual question on the tip of his tongue now, in fact, so I head him off: Ill show you someday, I promise. Just not yet. Jorin only shrugs in response, as though he expected as much. I always find some excuse to put him off, since my efforts never live up to the images in my mindat least not yet. I am improving, though, and I havent given up hope that one day Ill make something beautiful.
Speaking of beautiful, here is the river before us now, low from the lack of rain, but still cool and clear and glinting in the sunlight. I throw down my basket and dip my feet in the water, and for a moment, if I look away from the ark and hold my breath to avoid the stench, I can almost believe Im in paradise.
And then I notice the group of women washing their own laundry a bit downriver. They glance from me to the ark with narrowed eyes, whispering and clucking their tongues and even wrapping cloths over their mouths and noses as if my appearance has made the odor twice as unbearable.
No, this village is no paradise, and those women will not let me forget it.
I grab one of Fathers tunics, plunge it in the water, and begin to scrub the dirt out much more vigorously than necessary. Youll exhaust yourself before youre halfway through, Jorin warns, and I flick some water in his direction. Accidentally, of course.
Would you like to help, then? I ask, and Jorin grows suddenly silent.
We work quietly for a short whileor rather, I work while Jorin restswith only the soft swish of river water and the womens distant whispers to accompany my scrubbing. And then the circle of women cracks open, and out of their midst comes my best friend Derya, flouncing toward us with a basket of soaking-wet laundry dripping in her arms, her long black braid swinging at her back. When she reaches us, she dumps her laundry in the river and continues washing as if nothing has happened.
Well, good morning to you too, Jorin says after a moment.
Derya just shakes her head. Those women are insufferable, she says. Anger turns her green eyes into sparks against her golden skin, and as usual, I feel dull as river mud beside her. But Im grateful for her support. As if its your fault, she goes on, that Noah believes a great flood is going to destroy the world!
And there it is: the reason Grandfather has devoted himself to this interminable project, has forced my father and uncles to neglect their own duties in order to help him. Thanks to Noah, our village is now a destination for unsavory nomads in search of work, and with all the trees felled to build the ark, mudslides plague us throughout the rainy season. In any other man, such behavior would never be tolerated. But my grandfather was once one of our villages most respected members, and his madness grew slowly, over years, plank by plank as the ark rose higher, until suddenly it was too large to ignore and too late to act against it.
I still remember the day I first heard about the rains that would supposedly fall till our cottages were submerged, our animals drowned, though I cant recall who told me, or whether I simply overheard the gossip. But I will never forget the way I tore through the village, heading straight for my father at work in the smithy, and I will never forget how I ran inside without calling out first, even though I was forbidden to do so. Father was pouring molten bronze into molds, but to my young mind and eyes, it was as if he held liquid fire just a few hands breadth from his body, at the end of a long, precariously thin wooden handle. If he was a more excitable man, a less steady one, there might have been a terrible accident. As it was, I suffered only a scolding once Father put the smoking-hot pot down on the smith stone and led me back outside, away from the open flame and molten metal. And even his reprimand was light, once he realized how frightened I was; he never could be harsh with me. I remember how he gathered me in his arms, so close that I rested my cheek against the warm leather of his apron and breathed in the smoky residue that lingered there. He told me that there would be no flood, that old Noah wasnt right in the head, though I should never say so aloud.
But how can you know? I whispered into his chest.
He breathed out, long and deep, and I bit my lip as I waited for him to speak. I suppose nothing in this world is certain, he said at last. But I promise that if you, if any member of our family is ever in danger, Ill do everything I can to protect you.
Now, as I wash Fathers tunics in the river, I realize I cant remember the last time I visited him at the smithy, or even exchanged more than a few words with him over supper. The ark has kept him busy, I suppose.
It takes me a minute to notice Derya is no longer chattering beside me, and I crane my neck to see her standing beside Jorin, facing away from the river. Can you imagine, she says softly, all of this, justgone?
I turn and follow her gaze, taking it all in: the mud-brick cottages, the bits of straw embedded in their walls and roofs gleaming golden in the sun; the fields of wheat and barley, low and parched now that the harvest has ended; the pens of grazing goats and cattle and sheep; the forested hills that cup our valley in their protective hands. It may not be much, in the scheme of the wide world Ive heard tales of but never seen, and I may not always feel welcome here. But this is the only home Ive ever known, and no, I cannot imagine it destroyed.
Well, you cant blame Noah for being a bit confused, Jorin says. After all, he is six hundred years old.
Derya and I both scoff at that. At sixty, Noah is the oldest man in our village, and many joke that he might as well be six hundred.
Sometimes, I blurt out, I wish he would just die already. The words are out before Ive realized what Im saying, and I clap my hand over my mouth, horrified. I mean, I go on, the words muffled by my fingers, I wish he would be cured of his affliction But I know the chances of that are slim, and sometimes, buried deep inside, in a hidden, horrible part of myself, I do wish Noah were dead.
Youre not the only one, Cousin. My nerves jump as if Ive been caught in a crimeand perhaps I haveas I see Kenaan approaching. I want to know how much hes heard, but I cant find out without repeating all Ive said, so I return to my laundry. With all these interruptions, Ill be here till the sun sets.
Im not the only one distracted by Kenaans presence: Derya has abandoned her washing entirely, and the women downriver are looking our way as well, their whispers turned soft and melodious. They dont blame Kenaan for his grandfathers faults, for my cousin is the handsomest young man in the village, with his head of curls nearly as dark and polished as the wet pitch coating the ark. But much more pleasing to the eye, of course.
Shouldnt you be up on the ark, Kenaan, working with my father and yours? I snap. Im irritated, suddenly, and my cousins unexpected laughter doesnt help.
No, Im afraid not. He glances around before continuing, his voice lower. Grandfather Noah has an even stranger task for me. He laughs again, and I realize the sound is bitter, even panicked, not a real laugh at all. You know how he had me building birdcages? I look to Jorin and Derya before nodding. Neither looks surprised, so I guess Kenaan has told them as well. WellKenaans voice grows even softera few days ago, he asked me to build smaller square cages, with wooden bars running both horizontally and vertically, and only the smallest spaces left open for ventilation. He told me they must be secure enough to hold snakeshe slithers a hand up Deryas bare forearmand spidershis fingers skitter up to her shoulderand scorpionshe pinches her nose, and she laughs and bats his hand away.
You joke, she says.
The smile slides off his lips. No, he says, I couldnt invent that story ifI tried. The other two might not believe him, but I know hes telling the truth. Invisible spider legs scurry up my own arms, and I have to fight away a shiver despite the heat. What use could Noah possibly have for snakes and insects?
Anyway, Kenaan says, his dark eyes now aimed directly at me, I just came to tell you Noah has called a meeting tonight. For the entire family.
The spider legsor are they scorpion claws?close around my throat, choking off my breath for a moment.
Kenaan saunters off, with Derya looking longingly after him, as I tackle another filthy shirt. Perhaps, I realize now, Ill learn the answer to my question sooner than I anticipated. Though Im not so sure I really want to know.


Chapter Two


I grit my teeth as my mother tugs the wooden comb once again through my knotted hair. You knowyankI am perfectly capableyankof combing my own hair.
If that were true, Mother says, then I wouldnt have to fight a weeks worth of tangles to Unh! She pulls down so hard that stars dance before my eyes, and when my vision clears I see the huge clump of hair thats fallen before me, a shade darker than the packed earth floor of our cottage. Maybe I should comb my hair more often.
I fidget and squirm, trying to relieve the pressure on my scalp, and my skin rubs against the coarse, itchy fabric of my woolen dress. Its my finest dressI dyed it a deep golden yellow myself, using the flowers of the saffron lilybut its much too heavy for this warm weather. Mother practically ordered me to wear it; she thinks Noah called this meeting to announce that Kenaan and I will marry, and she could not be more pleased.
It makes sense, I supposeno other man in the village will have me, although Im sure many girls would put up with a madman in the family in order to wed Kenaan. I dont know how Ill react if Mother is right. Kenaan is certainly handsome, and he has always been kind to mewell, as kind as any mischievous boy whos known me since we were both babes. Hes respectful toward his parents and especially sweet to his younger sister, Shai. But I know how much Derya likes him. And truthfully, though Im already sixteen, I dont feel ready to marry.
Still, I cant manage to muster much emotion about any of that right now. I keep thinking about the rush to cover the ark with pitch, about Noahs strange assignments for Kenaan, and I cant imagine that marriage is my grandfathers main concern. No, I suspect this nights meeting is about something else entirely, and worry crawls up and down my spine at the thought.
My mother jerks at another tough tangle, and I cry outjust as Arisi walks into the cottage. I swear her belly swells larger with every day that passes, and she still has three moons left before she gives birth. My youngest aunt is so small, her bones nearly as delicate as those of a bird, that I fear if the baby grows much more, she will topple over.
For now, though, Arisi makes her way gracefully toward us, balancing her excess weight so effortlessly she seems to skim above the ground. Here, Sistershe reaches a hand toward my motherlet me.
No, no, Mother and I both protest, but Arisi has already grabbed the comb and begun to work out the last tangles in my hair. She is much gentler than my mother, and my scalp thanks her even as I hope shes not overtaxing herself.
I watch my mother wander the cottage common room, searching for a new task to occupy herself, and something clutches tight inside me for a moment. She looks so old next to Arisi; her black braid is threaded through with strands of silver, and a spider web of wrinkles has wrapped itself around her thin neck. Of course, Arisi is only nineteen, more of a sister than an aunt, so to compare the two isnt really fair. Still, it doesnt help that Mother narrows her eyes, accentuating the lines at their corners, and purses her lips as though shes swallowed a sour grape whenever she catches sight of Arisis stomach. I know that my mother was pregnant several times after my birth, and always the baby came too early. I know that she desperately wanted a son, and now, claiming Kenaan as a son-in-law is the closest she can come. But I still dont feel ready to marry.
Does that make me a terrible daughter?
No, it doesnt, Arisi whispers so close to my ear that I can feel the soft slap of her breath against my skin. I jump, and Arisi laughs. Am I incapable of keeping my thoughts to myself today? Dont worry, she goes on, she didnt hear you.
In fact, Mother is making her way out of the room, probably to bank the kitchen fire before we leave for Grandfathers. Arisi sighs and collapses onto the wooden bench against the wall, and I sit beside her. So, I say as she leans her head on my shoulder, how distraught do you imagine Mother will be when she learns my marriage is the last thing on Noahs mind?
I dont know, Arisi murmurs, but I wouldnt switch places with you tonight.
You wouldnt switch places with me ever. I pull back to look at Arisis bright cheeks, her warm brown eyes. She plays with the ends of her silky, tangle-less hair with one small hand. I feel so large, so unkempt and ungainly in comparison. I inherited my fathers height, his broad shoulders, long legs and arms and fingers, and sometimes I wonder if any man could care for me.
How did you know, I ask Arisi, that Japheth was the man you should marry?
I realize before the words are out that my question is a foolish one. The entire village knew Arisi and Japheth would marry, probably before the couple themselves recognized it. They were always together, Japheth always gazing at Arisi as if she were some jewel unearthed miraculously from the soil, and she looking at him in much the same way.
Arisi is silent now, thoughtful, and Ive given up on her answer when she finally says, I couldnt imagine sharing my home and my bed with any other man. It was as simple as that. And, I think, she was willing to sacrifice her ties to her own family as well. Arisis parents havent spoken to her since she married a madmans son, but if shes not going to bring that up, I wont either.
Mother invades our quiet, her steps slap-slapping across the earthen floor: she has put on her one pair of leather sandals, and she holds my pair out as well. When I take the shoes from her, she leans forward to examine a lock of my hair, then arranges it so a few sections hang over my shoulders, framing my face. She steps back to survey her handiwork, her lips playing between a scowl and a smile, and for a second I hope shell say I look beautiful. Instead, her mouth settles into a flat, neutral line. That will have to do. Her tone is curt but resigned. Come along, both of youFather Noah will be waiting.

***

My grandfather Noah is known for the stark white shade of his long hair and beard, as befits a man of his age. But Noahs hair turned white all at once, overnight, when he was a much younger man. Or so they sayI was not born yet, of course, and neither was my youngest uncle, Japheth, Arisis husband.
Ive heard so many versions of the story, whispered in warning from mothers to daughters, passed around by bored women as they weave and spin, exaggerated into laughs and shouts by men giddy from too much wine. But in its simplest and, I think, truest form, the story goes that Noah and his wife, my grandmother Nemzar, were set upon by bandits in the night. My father and Uncle Ham had already married and started their own homes, so my grandparents lived alone in the largest cottage in the village, as they still do now. Their closest neighbors must have known what was going on, but no one came to help Noah, or even ran to fetch my father or uncle. Instead, as Noah is fond of repeating, they all stayed hidden within their own dwellings, protecting themselves and their possessions. To tell the truth, Im not sure I blame them, or if I would have had the courage to do any different.
In any case, the bandits clubbed Noah over the head and stole his greatest treasures: the gold pendant hed given Grandmother as a wedding gift, the obsidian and lapis lazuli hed traded his best bronze work for. Worst of alland this part isnt spoken of in the village, only whispered by my mother and Aunt Zeda when they think no ones listeningNoah awoke to find his wife on the floor, moaning in pain, her clothes torn and spotted with blood. Noahs hair had turned white by the next morning, and he began to hear a voice within his head soon after, a voice that called itself the Lord God. The voice that told him to build the ark.
Less than a year later, my uncle Japheth was born.
Knowing the whole story, youd think my grandmother would be the one most affected by all that took place. Youd think if anyone would carry the mark of that night on her body and in her mind, it would be her. But watching Grandmother Nemzar now, as she balances plates of bread and goat cheese and a bowl of the last fresh figs of the season, Id never guess anything awful had happened to her. She weaves agilely between the rest of my gathered family, smiling and refusing help as she places the food on the low wooden table. Her hair is still a bright, deep reddish brown, like the wood of the cedar tree, with only a few hints of gray. Sometimes I think I see the same red tint in my own hair, but its probably just wishful thinking, or a trick of the lightafter all, my parents share the same dull brown-black locks, so why should I be any different?
Grandmother sets a plate at the head of the table, and I have to look carefully to make out the wrinkles on her brown hands and arms. To tell the truth, Grandmother barely seems older than my own mother, and she certainly looks nothing like Noah, who stands now at the head of the table, his own hands trembling like two ancient pieces of tree bark. Its as if Noah, with his white hair and leathered skin and the heavy robe he wears over his tunic even on the hottest summer day, has absorbed all the trauma of that long-ago night for himself. Its as if hes taken hold of all the pain and anger in this house and left none for Nemzar, or for the rest of us, and Im not sure whether what hes done is a kindness or a curse.
Grandfather Noah is still tall, though, like my father, with Fathers broad shoulders and broad back, and its not too hard to believe he was once the most powerful man in our village. After all, Noah was the bronze smith, like Father after him, and the village couldnt survive without the tools he provided. My father should have already begun teaching Kenaan the trade, as wellbut the ark has kept them both too busy.
At times like this, when Noah stands only a few paces from me and I remember that hes just one old man, no longer so powerful, I wonder why my father and uncles dont simply refuse his commands. Yes, the village custom demands we obey and respect our elders, but surely in a case like this.
Then Grandfather speaksand I begin to understand.
Sit, please, he says, and at once the room falls silent. We have much to discuss. Though his words come out soft and low, his voice fills every bit of empty space, a thick rumble that seems to hold density and weight. Its a knowing voice, almost otherworldly, and hearing it almost makes you want to believe what he says.
Almost.
Once my father sits on Noahs right side, my uncle Ham on his left, and the rest of us have gathered at the long wooden benches around the table, Noah goes on. Let us thank the Lord God for our food, he says, and the uneasy glances pass from one of us to the next like a series of muffled coughs. Even my ten-year-old cousin Shai, who sits directly across from me between her mother and brother, knows enough to appear ashamed of Noahs strange practice. My grandfather, however, doesnt see us: his head is bowed in prayer, his eyes closed. And Ham, I now notice, mirrors his position. Is this just another of my uncles many attempts to gain favor with his father? Orhard as it is to fathomhas Ham actually begun to believe in this God Noah speaks of?
Noah says that the Lord God who speaks to him is the only god, that this one, sole God created the earth and everything upon it. He created the soil and the grass and trees and other plants that grow upon the earth; he created the river that waters our village; he makes the rain fall and the sun shine, and he even made the great sea that traders have described to us, though Im not sure I believe it exists, a body of water so long and wide it goes on farther than the eye can see, mirroring the sky above it. This one God, Grandfather says, made every living thing on the earth, from the smallest, most bothersome gnat to the fearsome creatures Ive caught sight of when they prowl too near our village, the great cats with claws sharp enough to tear a man in two, or so Father has warned me. This Lord God, Noah says, also created man, and we must thank him every day for our existence.
All this runs through my mind in the space of one breath, as Noah keeps his eyes closed and murmurs into his clasped hands. At last he raises his head and clears his throat, but Ham keeps his head down a moment longer. So he is trying to please his father. The curse of the second son, my own father calls it, though I suspect Ham would act the same whether he was the second son or the seventeenth.
We begin to pass food between us, though I think most of us are more anxious to hear Noahs words than to fill our stomachs. Kenaan keeps glancing at me across the table, a smirk pulling at the corners of his mouth, and I wonder if his mother made the same assumption mine did about the purpose of tonights meeting. He takes his attention from me to place some meat on Shais plate, and its then that Noah speaks.
The Lord God tells me, he begins, his voice as calm and composed as if hes recounting a days work in the fields, that men have grown wicked upon the earth, and the Lord is sorry He has made them. The Lord will send a great flood to cover the earth and destroy all men. But the Lord has seen that I and my family are righteous, and He has told me to build a great ark, to preserve us when the waters come.
All this we have heard before. But now, Noah pauses only to take a sip of wine, and goes on. In just seven days time, God will send rain down for forty days and forty nights, and the great flood will blot out all life upon the earth.
A rush of feeling crashes over me all at once, as cold and bracing as the river water was this morning, and for a moment the emotion is too strong to identify. I look instinctively to Father at Noahs right, and I see his lips part as he lets out a long, heavy sigh. And only when I recognize the same emotion on my fathers face do I understand what Im feeling: relief. Finally, after years of enduring the villagers taunts and snubs, after watching my father and uncles and even Kenaan overwork themselves for Noahs whims, after watching Arisi forced to choose between her husband and her family, its almost over. In seven days, when the flood does not come and the world is not destroyed, Noah will have to give up his madmans mission. And though the ark will still stand, perhaps the rest of us can return to some semblance of a normal life.
But Grandfather Noah is still speaking, and Fathers mouth has closed, his lips drawn tightly together.
will bake as much bread as possible and carry it to the ark, along with grain and barley, salted meat and fish, dried figs and raisins. We will fill as many water skins as we can at the river, for when the rain comes we may not be able to step onto the deck and gather rainwater for several days.
By we, I realize, Noah means the women. Including me. And including Arisi, who is
This is madness! Our heads turn as one to the far end of the table, where Japheth has pushed his uneaten food away and is standing, fists clenched. I will not allow you to put my wifes health in danger, not when she is with child. Ive sacrificed for you, all these years, but Arisi will not spend her days hauling food through the village for no reason but
Noahs face has remained placid all evening, no matter how strange his words, but now his eyes narrow and his mouth twists. You, my youngest son, will question my wisdom? You will question the Lord Gods word?
So is it your wisdom, or Gods? I think but do not say. Japheth sits againor rather, he nearly falls back onto the benchand looks to my father, his eyes wide, beseeching. We all know that if anyone can sway Noah, it will be his eldest son. My father opens his mouth, closes it. Finally he says, If we listen to all you say, Father, then will you listen to our concerns as well?
Noahs expression tightens further in disapproval, and his wrinkles deepen into fissures across his skin. He clears his throat, and then continues as if he was never interrupted. I suppose this is the closest hell come to agreeing.
We must also carry as many bales of hay as possible to the ark, for we wont be feeding only ourselves: God has commanded me to bring two of every animal, one male and one female, into the ark with us, so that they might survive the storm.
A short, biting laugh echoes from across the table, an expression more of disbelief than humor. Ham casts a disapproving glare in his sons direction, and Kenaan bites his lip and grows silent. I wish I could laugh as well, could say or do something to break the tension tightening throughout the room as Noah goes on:
The kept animals, the goats and sheep, fowl and cattle and swine, we can take from our own
Noah keeps speaking, but my mind is already darting ahead to the cages Keenan has been building, the cages for scorpions and spiders and snakes. Any God who would ensure that those creatures survive while so many humans perish must be as mad as Noah himself.
Noah says that the men will need to trap rabbits and mice, foxes and deer, birds of all types, and, yes, reptiles and insects. Already it seems he has surpassed all his earlier lunacy in only a few words, but what he says next sends a ripple of shock through me.
The savage animals, the tigers and lions and other great cats, the bears and wolves and hyenas, I do not expect you to trap alive. But God commands me to preserve all His creatures, so I have hired hunters to procure these animals.
Shai lets out a whimper. Id hoped she hasnt understood all that Noah has said, but apparently shes grasped enough. Zeda places a hand on her daughters arm, but my aunts fingers are trembling too much to provide much comfort. At the far end of the table, Japheth lays a hand on Arisis stomach as if to shield both her and the babe. The rest of us remain rigid, our bodies tight and taut, as though we are withdrawing into ourselves to escape some unseen threat.
Father. My own father speaks slowly, deliberately. I have done my best to be a dutiful son, to obey and respect you in all things. But thisthis I cannot accept. You cant bring wild animals into our village. You will endanger our children, our homes, our entire community.
God will protect us from
I have never seen Father, have never seen anyone interrupt Noah, but he does so now. If I dont stop you, he says, the rest of the village will.
Noah does not explode in anger as I thought he would, as he did when Japheth spoke. Perhaps he is too caught up in his own mind, in his strange ideas, to realize just what my father has done. God will not allow the people of this village to disrupt His plan, he says.
Across the table, Shai is crying.
Nahala, Father says to Mother, his voice hard, take Neima and go home. I need to speak to Father alone. Only a moment passes before Ham and Japheth say the same to their wives. We stand, leaving our untouched plates behind, and I cant help thinking that later, Grandmother Nemzar will have to clean all this up.

***

Outside, the sun has disappeared, but the moon and stars shine so brightly it might still be day. Ill miss these clear nights, when the rainy season begins and the clouds hang low, though Ill welcome the droughts end. Shai is still sniffling, and I want to comfort her, but Zeda grabs her by the arm and hurries off. My mother, too, walks ahead, her back rigid with displeasure. Can she possibly still be upset about me and Kenaan? Only Arisi and I walk slowly, taking in the open night air, which has cooled enough to feel like bliss after the stifling, overstuffed cottage.
You know, Arisi sayssoftly, though the village is quiet now, nearly everyone inside eating or sleeping alreadythese animals Noah speaks of may not arrive. Perhaps he is so confused that he only believes he has procured them.
Perhaps. I hope Arisi is right, but with all his years here, Noah has come to know every trader who passes through our village. Some of those traders deal in animal skins, and furs, and even great tusks. If the traders dont hunt themselves, they surely know others who do. And Noah will spare no expense to get what he believes he needs. Hell probably even pay with his sons food stores and livestockafter weve loaded the ark, of courseand then well all go hungry this winter, if we arent mauled by wild animals first.
That is, if Father cant talk Noah out of his madness.
It will be all right. Arisis voice jolts me from my thoughts, and I realize were in front of the small cottage she shares with Japheth. Somehow, she says, it will be all right. We have to believe that, or else how can we keep going?
I think of Mother stomping ahead, of Zeda yanking Shai away. Anger, or embarrassment, or fear of what others will thinkso many things can keep people motivated, can drive them forward.
But I like Arisis method better.
Ill see you tomorrow, I say, and hopefully we wont be baking a years worth of flour into bread we cant keep.
She smiles. Tomorrow.
When shes gone, I make my steps even slower; Im not eager to return to our cottage and my mother. But then I hear a voice ahead of me, breathless and irritated:
Comebackhereyourascalofa Neima?
Jorin stops short, panting, but the goat hes chasing continues scampering through his fenced courtyard, bleating and shaking andwellshivering?
See? he says as he finally catches up to the goat. I told youshe shivers at night.
But its not cold. I find myself smiling for what seems like the first time in days, though I know its been only a few hours at most. Its such a relief to see Jorin acting as if everythings normal, as if the world isnt ending in just seven days. Because it isnt, of course, and our little world wont end either, no matter what my grandfather says and does. Like Arisi said, everything will be fine.
Jorin places one broad hand atop the goats back, and she quiets and slows her shaking, though she doesnt stop entirely.
Poor thing. I reach one hand over the fence to stroke the goats silky fur. Shes nervous.
Beneath my hand, her trembling slows further and then, at last, stops. Jorin moves his hand closer, until the tips of our fingers are touching, and looks up at me. It seems she just wanted some comfort, he says.
It seems that way, I agree. The moonlight settles against the sharp angles of Jorins face, and I stare a moment too long before I turn away.
Jorin? a rough voice calls from the door of his cottage. Have you caught that goat yet? Who are you
The broad silhouette of Jorins father appears in the doorway, shoulders set and face creased with displeasure.
I should go, I whisper. Needless wordsIm already backing away.
Good night, Neima, I hear Jorins hushed voice from behind me as I continue home.

***

Inside, the cottage is dark and Mother lies on her pallet, her eyes closed. I doubt shes asleep; more likely she just doesnt want to speak to me, or to Father when he arrives home. I quickly shrug off this miserable woolen dress and slip into one of my linen shifts, and then I grab the wood remnant and my carving knife where Ive stashed them under my own straw pallet. In the kitchen, I stoke the fire just enough to see by and sit cross-legged before it.
I gaze at the wood, turning it over and over in my palm, trying to clear my mind of everything else: Grandfather Noah, the ark, floods and wild animals. Im still not sure what shape lies within it, but I brace the wood against one hand and pull my knife toward me, following the grain of the wood, until a small pile of cedar shavings litters the floor around me. My heartbeat and breath slow, matching the careful rhythm of my movements, until Ive pulled the curve of a head and slope of shoulders from the wood. I continue, molding a vague silhouette that no one else could identify, but I know who is taking shape from the wood: someone whos no longer a boy, but not quite a man, with hair the same shade as the knife I use to carve his form.



Chapter Three

My parents urgent whispers, coming from the kitchen, wrench me from sleep. I stretch my arms and legs on my pallet, working out the stiffness in my limbs; I can tell by the sunlight and birdcalls streaming through the small window that morning has come. I dont remember Father coming in last nighthas he slept at all? Have he and my mother been talking all night?
he would not take our side! I hear from my father.
More low mumblesMother is better at keeping her voice down.
Of course I spoke to Ham alone, Father breaks in, louder still. He would not be moved!
More from Mother, as I creep closer to the kitchen.
No, Father says, I dont think Ham truly believes in this God, or that the flood is coming. None of us do. But he thinks he can gain some special favor from Noah, and Neima. I jolt a little, but his voice softens. I know youre awake. You may as well come speak with us.
I move into the kitchen, and Mother swiftly turns her back on me to tend the firethough only after throwing a look of disapproval my fathers way.
Shes not a child, Nahala, Father says. He looks at me, his face sagging with sleeplessness, his hair rumpled as though hes been running his fingers through it, over and over. We can trust you not to repeat what youve heard, right, daughter?
I nod. So I swallow, suddenly aware of the dryness in my throat. Uncle Ham would not support you?
My mother rakes the bronze poker over the hearth with a sharp, metallic sound. No, hed rather let his wife and young daughter cart food to the ark for no purpose, let his son waste his time wandering the woods and trapping animals, let the rest of the village gawk and gossip and
I realize Mother is speaking against her own husband as well. Father does not look angry, though, only exhausted and somehow desperate, his wide shoulders drooping beneath the cloth of his tunic. I remember what he said to me so many years ago, when I first heard about the flood and the ark and ran to him in fear: I promise that if you, if any member of our family is ever in danger, Ill do everything I can to protect you. But Noah and Ham are as much a part of our family as Mother and I are, so how can Father act against them?
Still, a small, petulant voice within me whispers: Shouldnt he care for Mother, for me, most of all?
Now, Father clears his throat, interrupting my mothers complaints: It is only seven days. We will comply with Noahs demands, but we will draw out each task, doing as little as possible, so well have less to undo when the flood doesnt come. As he speaks, my father seems to grow taller, his stance broadening and his voice deepening. His brown eyes tighten in determination rather than defeat, and I realize it helps him to have a plan, to reclaim what control he can.
It should help me too, but I cant help thinking of
And what of the tigers and lions and wolves? Mother voices my own concerns, brandishing the poker as if to fend off an imagined beast.
Father sighs. We will deal with the animals whenifthey arrive.
And, I suppose, thats really all we can do.

***

We begin by baking bread, moving between Grandmother Nemzars kitchen and the courtyard outside her cottage, where we slide the loaves into the round clay oven. We make the loaves flatter than usual and bake them for longer, hoping theyll last and our flour wont be wasted, though our teeth will surely suffer from the hard loaves. Noah has already sent Japheth and Kenaan out into the hills above the village to set traps; Ham and my father are at the ark, making any last adjustments my grandfather deems necessary. Noah himself, however, is still here, puttering around the cottage and watching us and grumbling, until Im ready to cart supplies to the ark just to get away from him. And to escape the heat belching from the outdoor oven.
Aunt Zeda has brought a wooden cart over from her own cottage, as have Mother and I, so together with Grandfather Noahs cart we have three. We fill three cloth sacks with grain from the clay bin in Noahs courtyard, load them into the carts, and then Aunt Zeda, Mother and I each take one cart by the handle. We leave Grandmother and Arisi behind to tend the oven and grind more grain into flour, while Shai scampers after us.
Im immediately jealous of Shai as she skips and twirls in circles, relishing her freedom from the courtyard, until her twin braids fly out at the sides of her head and wisps of dark hair escape. This cart is heavy and cumbersome and leaves me feeling anything but free. The river and the ark look impossibly far away, especially when the carts creaky wooden wheels jar over every stick and stone in my path, and I have to jerk on the handle till my shoulder aches.
It gets worse, though: it seems everyone in the village is outside, feeding animals or baking bread in their own courtyard ovens or patching their roofs before the rains come. And it seems every single person stops his or her task to look at us, until their gazes feel warmer than the sun bearing down above us. Sweat trickles down the back of my neck and under my shift like some insidious crawling thing, and I want to shake both it and the stares away, but of course I cant. I swear the only villagers I dont catch sight of are Derya and Jorin, and Im not sure whether Im relieved or disappointed. Either way, judging by the whispers spreading far faster than my mother, my aunt and I can carry our load, my friends will know whats going on soon enough.
By the time we reach the flat wooden bridge that spans the river, my arms and shoulders throb as much from nervous tension as the physical exertion. We guide the carts carefully across the bridge, and then Im closer to the ark than Ive ever been before, the smell of the still-wet pitch so overwhelming Id cover my nose if I had a free hand to do so. Shai coughs and shakes her head and cries out, Momma, I cant live in there, even if there is a flood. Its cursed, its cursed!
Aunt Zeda just hushes her, so Shai runs to me, wrapping a small tan hand in my skirt. Its all right, I whisper, as much for my own comfort as hers. We wont have to live inside it.
But my father and Uncle Ham are coming toward us, circling around the arks hulking black side, and it occurs to me that while we may not be moving in, someone must deposit the grain inside. We cant leave it out here for birds and squirrels to peck at. And despite everything, Im curious to see more of this project thats consumed so much of my fathers and uncles time.
Father reaches us and lifts the sack from Mothers cart, and without asking whether I should wait, I haul up my own sackwith much less ease than he doesand follow him to the other side of the ark.
There is a doortwo doors, actually, one that opens to the left and one the rightboth propped open and both extending higher than the roof of our cottage. I must be gaping, for finally I realize Fathers been tugging on the sack in my arms, but my grip still wont loosen. Ill take it, Neima, he says. Go back to your mother.
No. I shift the bag thats growing heavier by the moment. I want to see.
He sighs as if hed guessed as much, and then I follow him, stepping up, for the floor of the ark is more than a foots length above the ground, and through the massive doors.
I expected one open, cavernous space, so Im disconcerted to find myself in a dim hallway. I blink, adjusting to the sudden lack of light, and make out openings to rooms on either side of me; neither appears to stretch to the end of the ark. A ladder looms ahead of me as well, extending through a hatch in the ceiling, and Father notices me staring.
It leads to the second level, he explains. There are two floors within the ark itself, and then the deck house you can see from outside.
Two levels? Well, of coursethe ceiling above me is as high as the doorway, but only about half the height of the entire ark. Its just, the amount of work this must have taken
And all these rooms Father has led me into the one on the left, and two more open doorways lead off from it, further into the depths of the ark. But what did I expect? After seven years of work, with all the nomads Noahs hired, some returning year after year, I suppose almost anything is possible.
If only all that hard work actually served some purpose.
You can drop that here for now, Father says, his voice gruffI suspect he still feels guilty after this morning. I think he would do both Mothers and my work for us, if he could. Out of nowhere, I have the strange impulse to wrap myself around him the way I did when I was much younger, when even on tiptoe I could barely reach his waist. But Im far too old for that now, and besides, hes already turned to walk back out of the ark, into the midday sun.

***

Though we work as slowly as we can without rousing Grandfather Noahs suspicions, over the next days we cart dozens of sacks of grain, barrels of dried fruit and salted meat, and bales of hay to the ark. Even Arisi and Grandmother help, when we have no more flour to bake with and little grain left to grind. Im not sure which is worse: the glares and whispers and even laughter that grow bolder each time we pass through the village, or the knowledge that in just a few more days, well have to carry everything back againand through rain and over mud, most likely.
Kenaan doesnt help much, either, as he runs up several times a day to show Shai and me his latest catch. Once its a pair of skittering green things that dash frantically from one side of their cage to the other, making my heart leap in a strange way. I wish he could let them out, could answer their desperate call for releasebut not too near me or my cottage. Another time his cage holds a long, slithering brown snake like a coil of clay come to life. Still have to find a female, he says, so let me know if you step on one.
Do you even know if that ones male? I ask, already knowing the answer. Kenaan just looks away. I think half the time, he hasnt even managed to catch two of the same kind, much less one male and one female. He just trusts that no one will look too closelybecause who would?
On the afternoon of the third day after Noahs announcement, Kenaan tells me hes done with reptiles, and now hes going to trap birds. He waits till Shai is on the other side of the courtyard, eating raisins out of the jar her mother is loading, before he asks, Want to come with me? Maybe you can sing to attract them.
Huh. Kenaan knows I cant sing, and I think his entire invitation is a joke, until he goes on:
Please, Neima. Im so bored, and youre the only one who can know what Im doing.
I look down at my hands, red and blistered from so many trips with the cart, and then over at Mother, who is doing a poor job of pretending not to eavesdrop. Oh, just go, she says as she loads another sack with loaves of over-baked, nearly inedible bread. I know shes only agreeing because she wants Kenaan for a son-in-law, but right now, Ill take any opportunity to escape.
On the way out of the village, we run into Jorin, who narrows his eyes in exaggerated suspicion. Let me guesshe crosses his arms over his chestNoahs finally taken things too far, so you two are running away to the woods to live together. I thought youd at least take Shai with you.
Very funny, I say, but Jorins looking at Kenaanor, rather, hes looking at the box-shaped twig traps Kenaans carrying.
Are you hunting? he asks.
In a manner of speaking. Kenaan smiles. And your earlier guess is partly right as well: Noah has grown stranger still, and hes sent us into the hills to capture all manner of birds.
I guess Kenaans not so concerned with keeping our familys secrets after all, at least not from Jorin.
Jorin frowns. To eat, or
He wants us to trap them alive and uninjured, Kenaan jumps in. Beyond that, Im not sure. So it appears hes not willing to share all our secrets.
Jorin shrugs and then, accepting as always, breaks into a grin that reaches all the way to his eyes. Well, Ill come with you. Id do anything to escape this blasted sun and my fathers endless commands. Id even put up with your company. He nudges my shoulder as we head further into the delicious shade of the tree cover, up the first slight slope of the hillside.
I dont know, I say, you might scare all the birds away.
Truly, JorinKenaans shoulders grow rigid, and a new edge creeps into his voiceour task will be easier without you clomping around making noise.
Oh. Jorin stops walking, his own shoulders slumping, and looks from me to Kenaan and back again. Im sorry. I didnt realize He shrugs again and then, without another word, turns and heads back down the hillside.
Jorin, wait! I call after him. He ignores me, and I turn to Kenaan, hands on my hips. What did you do that for?
You didnt really want him tagging along after us, did you? Kenaan walks faster, so I have to hurry to catch up. Hes like a lost little lamb.
Kenaan! Yes, Ive had the same thought, but somehow its different, wrong, in Kenaans sneering tone. Hes just out of temper, I tell myself, tired of following Noahs every ridiculous whim, like the rest of us. And hes taking it out on Jorin.
We walk in silence for a while, the only sounds those of buzzing insects and twigs breaking beneath our bare feet and, of course, the calling and chattering and singing of birds above us. Already Im dreading the thought of caging even one of them, but hopefully well be able to free them in a few days. I breathe in long and deep as we climb higher into the hillsthe air smells of spicy pine and cedar and, best of all, its gloriously free of all traces of pitch.
After a few minutes more we reach a small clearing with a fallen log just the right size to seat two people. Thinking of the slinking, slithering creatures Kenaans brought back to the village the past few days, I inspect the log carefully before deeming it safe enough to sit, while Kenaan begins setting the traps. He arranges a complex pyramid of sticks that will fall when the bird disturbs the trigger stickwhich it will surely do, thanks to the pile of writhing worms Kenaan places beneath the triggerbefore he moves on to the second trap on the other side of the clearing.
With you here, he says, we can carry more than one at a time.
Mmm, I say, not really listening, for already a small brown bird is inching closer to the first trap, eyeing the worms inside. Its a yellow-throated sparrow, with one bright drop of color below its throat the exact golden shade of an egg yolk, placed as precisely as if someone has dabbed it on with a brush. I have a nearly irresistible urge to frighten the bird off, so I force myself to look away, toward Kenaan. What about the larger birds, I ask, the hawks and owls, cranes and swans? Will you trap them as well?
Kenaan snorts. If Noah wants those creatures on his ark, he says, hell have to find someone else to catch them. Or else theyll just die out when this supposed flood
The snap of the sticks falling reverberates inside me, as though someone has plucked a string within the muscles of my chest, my heart. By the time I turn my head, the swallow is already hidden beneath a layer of branches, its squawk of surprise the only sign left of its presence.
That was fast, Kenaan says as he makes his way back to me, not even stopping to make sure the sparrow is secure in its new cage. Lets hope our second bird isnt so quick, or well have little time to rest. He brushes a strand of hair off my face as he sits beside me, and when his hand lingers too long on my neck, I bristle. Im still irritated with him for what he said about Jorin, and his fingers are hot and moist against my skin. I try to pull away, but he cups my neck in his hand and pulls me closer, until the tip of his nose nearly grazes my forehead.
Kenaan What are you
Dont tell me you havent thought about this. His breath hits my cheek with each word, and then he gives that strange smile of his, lips pulled higher on one side.
Once more I try to pull back, but he lowers his hand to my shoulder and holds it tight, his face moving closer still until his lips are against mine and
Kenaan! I wrench away again, and this time he lets me go. I Im sorry butI dont think of you that way. I cant look at him, cant be this close to him so I stand and walk away, my eyes trained on the nearest tree trunk, my heart thumping with shock and embarrassment.
You dont think of me that way? His voice twists with bitterness and, I think, astonishment. You know we are to be married, right? You know no one else will have you, and soon youll have to get over this childish stubbornness and give me what I want.
I cant think, cant believe this is truly happening as I hear his plodding footsteps move closer, closer, and when I whirl around to face him hes right before me. I take one step away from him, two, three, and my shoulder blades slam into the thick trunk of the tree at my back. Kenaans dark eyes pierce into me, something predatory there, more animal than human, and my heart beats faster, the frantic flutter of a birds wings. Ive never seen him like this before: lips parted, teeth bared, as though hes about to bite down. Where is the boy Ive known all my life? The boy who helps Shai with her food at dinner, who picks his little sister up and twirls her around? The boy who flirts innocently with Derya at the river, and does every task his mother asks of him without complaint?
Hes angry with Noah, not with me, I chant to myself. Hes angry with Noah, not with me. But Im the one before him now, and its my body he grasps with both hands, making his way roughly over my shift, squeezing my breasts so hard they throb and then moving lower to my waist, and lower still, pinching the fabric of my skirt with both hands and lifting
My own hands are on his arms, pushing, pushing but his grip is too strong and my heartbeat is booming, not a songbirds wings but a hawks, an eagles, and as his hand clutches the bare flesh of my thigh I kick my leg out, hard, in the direction of the bird trap.
Theres the snap of twigs again, the bird rushing upward in a flash of brown and yellow, and Kenaan is turning toward the broken trap, swearing, and I run.
Hes not coming after me, but I cant stop. My hawk-wing heartbeat pushes my legs forward; the foolish tears pooling in my eyes turn my surroundings into a blur of green and brown. So I dont see him till Ive nearly collided with him:
Jorin. He reaches one hand out to steady me, and I force myself to hold still.
Neima, are you all right? I still cant see clearly, and Im not sure if his voice is concerned or only confused. Wheres Kenaan? I saw you two, but I wasnt sure
He saw? He saw what was just happening, and he did nothing to stop it?
I push his arm away and tear past him, and though he calls after me once, twice, he doesnt follow.

***

Though Im exhausted when I make it back to the village, I pause only to drink some water before I grab my cart for another trek to the ark. Getting straight to work seems like the best way to avoid questions and conversation, and it will provide an excuse for my sweaty, disheveled appearance. But more than that, Im afraid of where my mind might go if I stop moving for even an instant.
I try to focus on the familiar ache of my blistered hands, my sore legs and shoulders, but a question keeps rising to the surface: Who can I tell?
Not Mothershed probably be thrilled at Kenaans apparent interest in me, at the chance to force our engagement.
Not Fatherits improper to speak of such things to a man, and even if it wasnt, I cant imagine looking Father in the eye and telling him what Kenaan tried to do.
Not Arisibetween Noahs demands and the baby, she has enough to deal with, and I wouldnt want to worry her.
Derya? Perhaps, but I havent seen much of her the last few days. And she likes Kenaan so much Should I warn her? Would he do the same to her, or is it only that he believes he and I will be married, so he has some right to
No. I have to put it out of my mind, or I might go a bit mad myself.
I make two trips to the ark and back again, three, four, until the sun hangs low in the sky, bleeding streaks of orange and crimson into the horizon. I shovel food into my mouth without tasting it, avoiding my parents faces, my mothers questions. I fall onto my pallet in the darkness, finally allowing my tight limbs to turn to liquid as I collapse, and my shoulder hits something hard. I force myself to sit up again, to reach under my pallet for the offending item: the carving I beganwas it only a few days ago?
Carving useless objects out of wood is a strange, stupid, pointless habit. I grab the wooden figure by its crude shoulders and carry it into the kitchen, and then I throw it onto the smoldering fire.

Chapter Four


On the fourth day after Noahs announcement, the animals begin to arrive.
Even before that, though, the day starts off strangely: Aunt Zeda is loading her cart with all manner of supplies Noah never mentioned, flat clay oil lamps and flasks of olive oil, woolen blankets, clay plates and bowls, extra tunics and shifts. Can she have begun to believe in Noahs predictions? She mutters to herself as she works, shielding her cart as though the rest of us are spies or thieves. Perhaps this endless dry heat is making all of us a little crazy; it does seem to suck the moisture from our very minds, leaving our thoughts as heavy and motionless as rocks in a dry streambed. I wish the rain would come.
I do not wish Kenaan would come to Grandmothers courtyard, but he does, greeting his mother and sister first before sidling over to me as if this is any other morning. I might try to catch a hawk today, Cousin, he says. Maybe even an eagle. Would you like to accompany me?
I wont look at him, but I can hear the smirk in his words. No, I say sharply, focusing on the grain sack beneath my fingers.
I thought not, he mumbles under his breath as he saunters off. So this, I guess, is the closest well come to acknowledging what happened yesterdayunless he finds me alone. And I wont let that happen.

***

When I cross the river on my way to the ark, its not the animals I notice first, but the people. Villagers are actually clustered on the far side of the river, nearer the ark than Ive ever seen them before. Jorins father Munzir, a skilled carpenter and a powerful man in our village, speaks in a low rumble I cant quite make out and gestures wildly with his arms. The others follow his movements with their eyes, faces creased in what looks like worry or anger, looking toward
Oh. Barred wooden cages are spread everywhere, some taller than any man in our village, and a few strange men roam among them. The traders and hunters, I guess, and I catch sight of at least four of them. How odd that theyve all arrived at once, as though Noah really has orchestrated all this in a way beyond the power of any man. And Noah himselfhes speaking to one of the traders, peering into a cage, pointing at a row of items spread out on a blanket on the ground.
Not just any items, though. I recognize the way the sun glints off the metal, separating the sky into golden bars and dazzling the eye, and I cant keep from running forward despite the growing pit in my stomach. I know even before Im close enough to see clearly that these are Fathers greatest bronze works: spears and hammers, axes and knives, strong shovels and durable jugs, cuffs and bracelets that exist for no reason other than their beauty. This is years of toil, of time and skill and sweat, laid out on the ground, and Grandfather Noah will trade all of it for wild animals in wooden cages.
A high-pitched squeal comes from one of the cages, and I turn toward itand find myself staring straight at two lions. Two young lions, not newborns but certainly less than a year old, with eyes too large for their heads and wide, clumsy paws. I breathe out an instinctive sigh of relief, and then realize how foolish that isthey may be young, and certainly preferable to full-grown cats three times their size, but theyre still vicious beasts standing only a few paces from me, with just a measly set of wood bars to separate us.
They dont look vicious, though, at least not at the moment. One placidly licks a paw while the other explores its cage with unsure steps. It turns and looks right at me, letting out another high, lazy yip: the sound seems to be closer to a yawn than a growl.
One of the traders notices me looking and moves closer. Are you a member of Noahs family? he asks. His accent is so odd, some vowels too clipped and others too long, that it takes me a moment to decipher his words.
Yes, I finally answer, Im his granddaughter.
The man nods, his expression serious yet strangely sedate, as though dropping off young lions before a massive ark outside a small village is an everyday occurrence. You should be safe to enter the cage to clean it and to feed the cats, he says. As long as you dont provoke them, theyre young enough to remain docile. To prove his point, he reaches through the bars and rubs the nearest lion on the head. It doesnt protest, but Im still not eager to follow his lead. Just use caution and good sense, and remember: their teeth and claws are sharp, and they grow stronger and larger with every day. Im becoming used to his accent, but I almost wish I didnt understand his words. Especially when he adds, The same holds true for the cheetah and lynx. The bears, though, Id be wary of, even if they are young.
He sees me jolt and laughs. I take it you havent had a chance to look around yet? At least your grandfather asked for younger animals, where possible. It could be worse. Sense within madness, I think. Although, the trader adds, those wolves look full-grown to me.
Youd think I could keep from jolting again, but I cant.
The trader follows me as I weave through the scattered cages. I think my reactions to the strange animals amuse him, though if you ask me, Im taking this all rather calmly. Im not sure its really sunk in yet. In any case, the trader certainly knows more about the animals than I do, so I dont mind his presence.
There are hyenas and jackals, two stump-legged onagers with reddish fur and black stripes straight down the center of their backs, and bizarre birds that stand on one long, stick-like leg with the other bent. They have long necks, too, that curve in one downward loop and one upward one, and beaks larger than those of any swan or crane. But strangest of all is the color of their feathers: a soft, blushing pink Ive seen on no other animal, though it reminds me of the honey-scented flowers that grow between tree roots in the spring.
As we move closer, the birds open their great beaks and squawk; they spread wings nearly as wide as I am tall and wobble away from us until they hit the back of their cage.
Theyre skittish creatures, the trader says, and theyre far from home. Your grandfather will pay dearly for them.
Two humpbacked camels, not penned in but ambling around and chewing on the grass, keep wandering perilously close to the caged flesh-eaters. At first I think theyre only the traders animals, until I notice Noah inspecting one of them and haggling with the nearby trader. The camel just keeps chewing; it has no idea it will soon be trapped within the walls of a wooden ark.
A bit farther off, two strange, solid-looking animals are tethered to a small juniper tree by a length of rope, though it looks like between the two of them, they could pull the tree out by its roots if they were determined enough. As I move nearer, I see that their gray skin is wrinkled and tough-looking, almost like leather, with reddish hair scattered across their heads and backs. They have wide, floppy ears and, oddest of all, each has a long, tubular protrusion where its nose or snout should be. I think these creatures are elephants, the source of the huge tusks traders occasionally bring to our village. But only one of the two has anything remotely like those tusks, and theyre short, barely peeking out from either side of its long snout. Despite the animals size and the weathered look of its skin, it somehow reminds me of a baby smiling, displaying its first two teeth.
Theyre so big! I say when Im close enough to realize the larger of the twothe one with the tusksis nearly as tall as I am, and its four legs appear solid as tree trunks beneath its ample bulk.
The trader beside me begins to laugh, a deep rumble that lasts long enough to concern me.
What? What is it? I ask, inching away from the strange beasts.
Its justhe places a hand to his chest, as though he can push the laughter downif you think theyre large, Id love to see your face if you ever catch sight of their mother.
I still dont understand.
These are three years old at the most, he says, and still immature. A full-grown elephant looms above any man, and it weighs, Id say, three or four times as much as these young ones here. The elephant is to other animals asas this great ark behind us is to the cottages in your village.
I try to picture such an animal, and a shiver skitters up my arms despite the heat. It sounds as if a full-grown elephant could crush me beneath just one foot.
Im ready to back away even from these smaller specimens, but the trader places a hand on my arm. They are gentle giants, he says. His voice is calmer now, all the laughter expelled. Plant eaters, peaceful and intelligent. He releases my arm but beckons me forward, and, though Im still a bit wary, I follow. And friendlylook how theyre greeting you.
Both animals are waving their long snouts in an almost comical manner, reaching them up and down, twisting and curling them, stretching towardme?
Theyre trying to scent you, the trader says. Here He reaches for the nearest snout. Take hold of the trunk and blow into it, like this.
Trunk? I decide I prefer the term to snout as I follow his lead. The elephants skin is as tough as I imagined, but not unpleasant.
There, he says. Now youve greeted her, and shell remember your scent. Best not leave her brother out.
Are they really brother and sister? I ask as I take the trunk of the small-tusked elephant and blow gently into it.
He shrugs. They may as well be, now.
The elephant opens his mouth in a kind of smile and waves his trunk before my face with even greater enthusiasm, brushing against my forehead and nose. The female butts her head against the trader, demanding equal attention, until he pats her trunk. They really are as friendly as he said, and, in their own strange way, lovely. I hate to think of them separated from their parents, whether theyre truly siblings or not.
You know a lot about animals, I say.
Ive traveled quite a bit. He glances around as if ensuring were alone before continuing in a lower voice. The word is that your grandfathers trying to gather two of every animal in the world. He tilts his voice upward, halfway toward a question but not quite there.
Um I bite my lip. I think he is, yes.
Well, the trader continues, leaning toward me, about to impart a secret. Perhaps I should be nervous, so close to a man I dont know, especially after what happened with Kenaan. But I like this mans gentle treatment of the elephants, and besides, there are plenty of people nearby.
Well, he says again, Ive seen animals that are not here today, animals I doubt your grandfather has ever heard of. Ive seen beasts with leathered gray skin and thick bodies like the elephants, but shorter and squatter and much less pleasant, with a head and horn like a bulls and a temperament to match. Ive seen brown-furred creatures that swing from hand to hand in the trees, traveling great distances without touching the ground, and chattering to each other all the while much like humans making conversation. Ive seen
Please, I break in, forgetting to keep my voice down. Dont tell Noah about these creatures!
He laughs again. All right, I wont. But perhaps you can tell mewhat does your grandfather plan to do with all these animals? Why has he built this great, smelly wooden thing that seems almost an animal itself?
I think of all I could say: Noah is mad; or, A voice in his head commanded him; or, A great flood is coming. Finally, I settle on the truth:
I have absolutely no idea.

***

The villagers keep grumbling, led by Jorins father, until theres nothing to do but carry the animals into the ark, where at least theyll be hidden from prying eyes. My father and uncles have laid a large plank of wood diagonally from the door of the ark to the grounda gangplank, my trader, as Ive begun to think of him, calls itand they load the cages onto carts and wheel them in. When Japhethhe looks too young for me to think of him as Uncle Japheth, especially now, with that boyish, ill-humored scowl on his facecomes to retrieve the elephants, something occurs to me.
They wont suffocate, will they? I ask. If the arks doors are closed?
Well arent you the sweet one, he says a bit bitterly, worrying for the welfare of lions and wolves andthese long-nosed things. Dont worry. He prods the elephants along, and I want to tell him to be careful with them, but hes already far enough that he has to call out over the snarling and yowling and whining of many confused, frightened animals. There are windows in the second level of the ark, and a few openings between the lower and upper levels.
Hatches, my trader says as Japheth disappears behind a cage of mean and unhappy-looking weasels. Openings between levels of a ship are called hatches.
I cant stand to watch this much longerthe animals crying, my father and uncles sweating and swearing, the villagers grousing and gripingand soon Im thanking the trader and heading back across the bridge to the village.
Im almost across when a figure comes running toward me, a familiar bronze-headed blur. He brings back memories of yesterday afternoon that cause tension to coil in my stomach, and I walk faster, looking determinedly past him.
Jorin reaches me just as Im about to step off the bridge, and he stands there, trapping me, his breath fast and ragged. I dont like this.
Neima, he gasps out between breaths, you have to let meexplainabout yesterday
No. I start to push past him, and his warm brown eyes turn wide, desperate, in a way that only makes me angrier. Where was that concern yesterday, when I needed it? I dont want to hear it.
Jorin opens his mouth to speak, but before he can, I sense a presence approaching us from behind. I stiffen as a voice calls, Jorin? Why are you talking to her? Dont you have work to do?
Jorins jaw clenches; his muscles tighten, hands fisting till the veins stand up on his forearms. F-father, I
Before I can see how Jorin willor more likely, wontdefend me this time, I brush past him and hurry toward home.

***

On the fifth day, the clouds come in.
I sense their presence even before I step outside, for when I wake the house is as dark as night. Only the chattering of birds and Mothers grumbling from the kitchen tell me its indeed morning. More than that, though, I can feel the change in the air even through our thick mud-brick walls: the atmosphere has become close and heavy, like hot, sweaty fingers pressing against my skin. It gives me a strange urge to retch, which I must struggle to shake off.
When I do go outside, the clouds hang across the sky like a great mass of wool in a vat of blackberry dye, as though the entire world is in need of dark clothperhaps in preparation for mourning? Its hotter than ever, though now in a sticky, oppressive way, and I have to remind myself that once the first drops of rain break through, relief will come.
My load for the ark is lighter than usual today, for Ive stacked my cart full of empty leather water skins, which Ill fill at the river and use to water the animals aboard the ark. If I remember correctly, most of the animals had wooden water troughs within their cages, but I do steal our pigs food trough and clean it out, to hold the elephants water. Noah certainly wont mindI think hed be happy if we starved the pigs. Ever since he began hearing the Lord Gods voiceor so Mother tells me, since I wasnt alive yet to witness itNoah has showed a great distaste for swine, and he still refuses to eat their meat. He wont even allow Nemzar to bring the flesh of a pig inside their cottage.
As Mother, Aunt Zeda and I head to the ark in our usual line, we pass Derya standing outside her cottage, studying the sky. I lag behind, and the noise of the cart bumping over the still-dry earth is so loud, I know Derya must hear it. But she doesnt look my way. Finally I say, Derya, and she turns slowly toward me. Slowly andreluctantly? No, I must be imagining things, though her eyes lack their familiar spark.
Still, seeing her for the first time since Kenaan and Isince the bird trapping, Im overwhelmed by the need to tell someone, to tell her, my best friend, the one whos never judged me for Noahs madness, what has happened. The desire swells inside me like the rain within the clouds above, and I can barely hold it in for another second. Derya will toss her head and say Kenaans a vain, selfish boy, the same way she says the villagers are foolish and insufferable, and Ill feel so much better.
But Im not sure how to begin.
II havent seen you much the past few days, I say.
She looks down at my cart with narrowed eyes. Youve been busy.
Oh, its been awful. So much work for no reason at all. Once I start talking, the words come faster and faster. Did you see the animals? And now we have to water and feed those dangerous beasts
It hasnt been all work, though, has it? Deryas voice is sharp, slicing right through my words.
What do you mean? I have no idea what shes talking about.
She looks away, hesitating for a momentand then she turns those green eyes right on me. You and Kenaan. Hes telling everyone how you kissed him in the woods.
My cheeks smart as though Ive been slapped in the face.
Oh, dont look so shocked, Derya goes on. Did you really think hed keep quiet? She sucks in a heavy breath. How could you, Neima? You know how much Ive always cared for him, and youve never liked him at all.
I dont know what hits me harder: the fact that Kenaans telling people I kissed him, or that Derya believes him. I glance around to make sure no ones watching, and then I grab Deryas hand. No, I say, thats not what happened at all. KenaanheI pushed him away, but he tried to force The words are impossible to get out, no matter how badly I want to release them.
Derya snatches her hand away. Now youre lying too? Kenaan would never do something like that.
Panic swells suddenly inside me, like clouds invading my chest and throat. PleaseI glance around again, afraid Kenaans going to materialize out of the sweltering aircan we just go somewhere private, so I can explain? Ive wanted to tell you so much
Deryas eyes harden into little green gems. Drops of sweat appear on her creased forehead. No, she says. I never want to speak to you again.

***

She didnt mean it, I tell myself as I yank the cart forward, nearly tripping in my effort to put distance between me and myformer?friend. Sweat beads and drips down my own forehead, and I struggle to inhale the stale, soggy air. Deryas just upset, and this weather has us all on our last nerve. Noah and Uncle Ham and Aunt Zeda, Mother and Father and Kenaan, none of us are behaving as we ought
And why am I always making excuses for everyone else?
I dont think about any of this for long, though, because when I reach the far side of the river, there is a tiger. And it is not a cub.
The animal paces behind the thick wooden bars of its cage, its orange and black and white body immense, its muscles rippling beneath its fur in a way that reminds me of molten bronze: liquid and white hot and very, very dangerous. Every once in a while it draws its lips up and back in a snarl, revealing fangs that, even from a distance, I can tell are longer than my longest finger. Behind the tiger, another, smaller orange-and-black shape lies curled in the corner of the cage.
No other cages or free-roaming animals crowd the grass today; its as if the tigers owner arrived late on purpose, to avoid upstaging the other creatures with this great cats magnificence. And its ferocity
The same group of disgruntled villagers is here again, too, keeping well away from the cage. They protest in much lower tones than they did the day before, as though theyre afraid to let the tiger know its displeasing them.
Well, Im afraid as well. As soon as I can fill these water skins Im heading to the ark, and for once Ill be glad to step inside
Are you one of Noahs daughters?
The man who approaches me must be the tigers owner, for he certainly isnt from our village or anywhere nearby. His accent is even more inscrutable than yesterdays traders, though its completely different, a drawl that stirs his words together into a thick, soupy mass. He wears a strange outfit made entirely of leather, and a long, thick scar runs the length of one arm like a mark of honor, or bravery. Or perhaps just stupidity. Some wild creatures, I think, should simply be left alone.
Hes still awaiting my answer, and Ive begun to shake my head no when he gestures to my cart and the full water bladder in my hands. You take care of the animals, yes?
Uh
Ill show you how to feed the tiger.
I nearly spill water all over my skirt. Oh! No! Im sure my uncle, I dont really want to sentence anyone to this fate, but I settle on, Ham will be happy to learn. Ill go find him right
I showed the men already, but you should know as well.
I look around for my father or uncles or even Mother, knowing any one of them would put a stop to this, but they must all be inside the ark or back in the village. And the traderno, hunteris just standing there, so I reluctantly follow him closer to the tiger, aware of the villagers eyes on me all the while.
Soon Im close enough to see the tigers amber eyes that catch the sun in their corners, its long and incongruously delicate whiskers, the burnished tint of its fur. It takes my breath away. Behind it, the cub raises its head to look at me, a perfect miniature. Are theyare they mother or father and
Mother and son, yes. The hunter is right beside the cage now, and when he pulls free a wide panel of wood, my heart lurches: it looks like hes removed the entire back of the cage. He hasnt reallyits only an extra piece of wood propped against the backbut my nerves prompt me to ask:
Couldnt itshechew through those bars if she wanted?
The hunter gives me a mischievous, gap-toothed smile. She might try, if shes bored or angry enough, but I doubt shell get far. These are thick, strong bars of cedar woodhe strikes his hand against the front of the cage, making me jump back, though the tiger barely seems to noticeand shed have to break through quite a few to make an opening large enough for her body.
I hope hes right.
He slips the wood panel through the bars in the side of the cage, just in front of the pacing tiger, and pushes it along until it extends out the other side. Now, you can open the front of the cage to clean it and bring in food and water.
Wonderful. That makes me feel so much safer.
Tiger or no tiger, theres still an ark full of animals to feed, so I take my leave of the hunter and head back to the river to collect my cart.

***

I thought fresh pitch on a hot day might be the worst odor in the world, but I was wrong. The worst odor in the world is the urine and dung and sweat and fear emanating from dozens of caged, confused animals, all cramped together in a wooden structure on a muggy afternoon. When I first enter, the smell nearly knocks me over. I should probably clean out some of that dung, but I decide Id rather put up with it and get out of here faster.
Its dark in here, too, and with all the cages that werent here yesterday, I find myself stumbling as my eyes adjust. Gradually I make out my mother and Aunt Zeda, Father and Uncle Ham and Japheth, all running around carting sacks of grain and barrels of salted meat, looking nearly as frantic as the animals themselves. This is a huge job, and Im sure the presence of a tiger outside doesnt help.
Mother sees me and grabs me by the arm. Dont go near the meat-eaters, she tells me. The men will handle them. Im happy enough to obey her, but there are still so many animals leftin addition to the ones that arrived yesterday, Japheth has been trapping all week. Hes brought in two knock-kneed, trembling young deer hes fenced into a corner; porcupines and hedgehogs that appear permanently curled into prickly balls; rabbits and squirrels and even mice, though I suspect quite a few of those are already hidden in the dark recesses of the ark. Or perhaps the cats have frightened all the wild mice away, even from within their cages.
Some of the animals are so far outside my realm of experience, its hard to know what to feed them. When I reach the large, stick-legged birds Ive decided to call flower-birds for their pink, petal-like wings, I sprinkle grain on the floor of their cage. They peck disconsolately at it for a moment and then turn away. I can almost feel their homesickness through the bars between us, and it makes my chest ache.
Fish, a high voice calls just behind me, and I turn to see Shai. I didnt even realize she was here. Feed them fish.
I dont think
Shes already run off, and she returns a minute later with a handful of salt-cured fish. I frown down at it.
They live near the sea, she insists, breaking the fish into small pieces and throwing it right into the birds full water trough.
Shai! What are you doing?
The trader told me! she protests in the pouting voice of a child too used to being scolded.
Before I can say more, both birds hurry over and dip their heads into the water, their beaks opening and closing so fast they appear to be shaking, or shivering. In a few moments, the fish are gone.
Well. I put one hand on Shais shoulder, glad she was here to help me. Good job.
Shai follows me to the elephants, and I find that someoneprobably Japheth, as hes skilled and quick with woodhas built a two-sided fence, enclosing them against the ark walls, and filled the space with hay. Perhaps Japheth sensed how much I liked the elephants, and he wanted to give them what little comfort he could. Ill have to thank him.
Japheth has even built a little latched door into the fence, and I step through it, dragging the pig trough, while Shai follows with a water skin. As soon as I empty the water into the trough, the male elephant lumbers over, sucks the water up with his trunkand dumps it all over his back.
I want to call out the elephants name in reprimand, but he doesnt have one, so I just put my hands on my hips and say, What a waste! I had to carry that water all the way from the riv
The elephant blows the last drops of water from its trunk right into my face, and I gasp. Shais laugh rings out, and I swear the elephant is laughing too, along with his sister behind him, both their mouths open wide. And, all right, Im smiling as well. The cool water is refreshing, even if its wasteful.
Youyou Clearly Ill have to give the elephant a name. Ill call you Bilalwetbecause thats what youve made me.
The female elephant taps her trunk on my shoulder, reminding me not to leave her out.
We could call her Enise, Shai suggests, patting the elephant atop her head.
Enise means lovable or friendly, and both seem perfect to me.

***

By the time we leave the ark, the sun is low in the skyor it would be if we could see it, but the clouds have grown even thicker, nearly hiding the suns rays completely. At first Im just happy to breathe air free of animal odors, but then I see Noah facing Munzir and the clump of disgruntled villagers behind him. My chest tightens, and when I catch sight of Jorin standing beside the river, looking from his father to me with those wide, worried eyes, what last bit of breath remains is squeezed from my lungs.
Mother clutches my hand and yanks me forward. Come on, she mutters, leave the men to their arguing. We still have supper to prepare.
But as we move closer to the crowd, we cant help but listen to Munzirs shouts. His voice is so acrid, hateful, even, that I find it hard to believe hes Jorins father. Ill give you one more day, he says, and if that tiger isnt gone, Ill, Ill
Youll do nothing, Noah breaks in. His own voice is lower, calmer, yet it thrums with the strength of his conviction as he proclaims, For God will smite down any who interfere with His will.
Munzir opens his mouth, perhaps to laugh; but just at that moment a single drop of rain falls from the sky, so slowly, so agonizingly slowly, and lands with an audible plink on the crown of Munzirs forehead. It traces its way down the center of his nose, over the curves of his now-closed lips, and down his chin until it falls from the tip of his beard, disappearing into the dry, thirsty ground.
We all wait, breaths held, for the next drop to fall, perhaps on our own sweat-soaked, thirsty foreheads. But the clouds seem to be holding their breath too, and no more raindrops come. Instead, the words fall from Munzirs mouth:
If that tiger isnt gone by the day after tomorrow, he says, Ill burn down your precious ark, and every creature within it.


Chapter Five

On the sixth day, we feed and water the animals.
While Noah remains in his cottage all morning, unconcerned, my father and uncle argue over whether to leave the tiger outside the ark, where itshewill antagonize the villagers, or bring her inside, where she will antagonize the other animals. Eventually they bring her in, and the instant squeals and grumbles, whimpers and moans, and even a few low growls from throughout the ark astound me. The animals seem to possess some innate sense, beyond hearing or smell or sight, that alerts them to the presence of a true predator.
Even disregarding the tiger, though, the animals are clearly suffering from their confinement. Some pace and snarl in agitation; others appear listless and apathetic. I imagine that they, like me, are waiting for the slap-slap of the first raindrops against the arks wooden roof. I suspect that the echo of falling rain will dance beneath the arks high rafters, like a cacophony of eager footsteps; that it will sound nothing like the familiar hiss and sizzle of the raindrops disappearing into the thatched roof of our cottage. But I dont find out, for since that first drop of rain against Munzirs forehead, the clouds have held their breath. It feels like the world itself has teased us, tricked us, promising relief and then withholding it. My throat is so dry it aches, but I know every sip of water I take is one less for the animals
I save the elephants for last, and though Shai and I spend as long as we can petting and soothing them, Enise and Bilal still bellow after us when we must go. We cant allow Munzir to destroy the ark and
Apparently my father and uncles have the same concern, though perhaps not for the same reason, for I find them gathered before the arks open doors, arguing again. Noah is here too, proclaiming that God will take care of Munzir, that we need only to wait. Ham nods in agreementsincere or not, who can tell?while Father murmurs that Munzirs threats are likely just hot air, and Japheth says that the rain sure to come at any moment will distract the entire village. My stomach churns; my throat burns even hotter. They arent going to do anything. They arent going to protect the animals weve stolen, wrenched from their wild homes for no reason at all. The whole thing makes me sick to my stomach.
I hurry ahead to the cottage, wanting nothing more than to be alone. The villagers threats and taunts, Keenans lies, Jorins and Deryas betrayalsits all too much. I have never felt so small and so powerless.

***

I sleep poorly and wake early to a hissing sound, like a serpent against my ear. I curl into myself, shivering a bit, when I realize it:
The temperature has dropped. The hissing sound is wind, and water. The rain has come.
I jump up, my shivers goneits not cold, just wonderfully cool, with a whirling breeze carrying the scent of rain through the windowand hurry outside. As I expected, the whole village seems to be standing outdoors, faces tilted upwards, the children laughing and squealing and catching raindrops on their tongues. The rain is light, a mere tickle on my skin, and it lifts the tension from my muscles as surely as its lifting the drought and heat from the earth. How could anyone think of fire, of flames and destruction and death, at a time like this? Even Munzirs spirits will lift today, and hell hold off. Im sure of it.
By the time Ive tended to our own sheep and goatstheyve certainly been neglected these past seven days, poor thingsand headed back inside, my tunic is soaked through. I change into a dry one and, on impulse, wrap a wide cloth belt of cornflower blue around my waist. I want to feel as fresh and new as the world around me, if only for a moment, before Im wet and muddy and disheveled again.
Mother tells me not to go to the arkonly the men are going today, in case Munzir does try somethingand Im surprised to find my mood deflating. I realize I was actually looking forward to the ark, despite the wretched smell and endless work, for the chance to see Bilal and Enise, the flower-birds and even, from a distance, the tiger.
Mother has her spindle out, and I begin to thread the loom, which will occupy so much of my time in the rainy months to come. I choose a light gray yarn, dyed with iris root, that reminds me of the shade of Bilals skin. By the time Ive woven this cloth, Bilal and his sister will be long gone, roaming near some ample lake where they can waste as much water as they want splashing each other
It seems that only a moment has passed when the whisper of rain against the walls dissolves all at once, swept away in a sudden torrent of sound, a rush of water tumbling earthward with the roar of some great beast. Rain spits sideways through the windows, threatening to turn our floor to mud, and Mother jumps up to close the wooden shutters.
Its really coming now, she says, quite unnecessarily, but I understandthis strangely transformed world just begs to be acknowledged aloud, as if only doing so will make it real.
A crash comes out of nowhere, a sound not of water but of something solid rending, splitting, falling, followed by shrill screaming. I run to the door without thinking and the water hits me like a wall, blinding me, pushing me back. It takes all my strength to force my way outside, where, eyes narrowed, I make out children bracing themselves, hands on knees, some down on all fours in the now-slippery earth. The rains can be ferocious, yes, especially when they first arrivebut have they ever been like this before? Not in my lifetime, I dont think.
I struggle forward till I can just glimpse the cause of that solid crash, blurred through a curtain of rain: a cottage has crumbled to the ground, its roof split down the middle, its foundation collapsed under the weight of the roof and the water. My throat tightens: that isor wasHannahs dwelling. As a widow with no sons, Hannah had no one to shore up her cottage before the rainy season. How many years have passed since anyones even offered to patch her roof?
I look for Hannah herself, knowing Mother would want me to offer her shelter, but I cant see past the crowd of taller villagers quickly forming around her cottage. Someone will take care of her, at least.
Another crash rings out over the rain, the sound reverberating down to my bones, and before my eyes the roof of another cottage slides forward, over the still-standing walls and all the way to the ground, as easily as mud sliding down a hillside. And this is Emirs house. I saw him repairing his roof just a day or two ago.
Im trapped in place, suddenly, my body turned solid as stone in my bewilderment and fear, even as the world is tearing to pieces before me and the rain seems determined to knock me onto my knees. And then, through the swirl of wind and water, a single word rises, a harsh, cutting word, repeating and gathering strength like a chant:
Curse. Curse. Curse. Curse. The ark has brought this curse upon us.
I need to move. I need to run to the ark and warn the men, or hurry back to my mother and tell herwhat? That our roof may cave in on her?and Arisi and Grandmother Nemzar and even Aunt Zeda, I must tell them too. Why cant I move?
When I see my father appearing out of the chaos, his form parting the sheets of rain before him, I dont trust my eyes. But his rain-slicked hand on my arm is real enough, and my feet finally remember how to lift and step forward, as he leads me back to our own cottage.
Inside, my mother grabs Fathers arms and pulls him to her, but he shakes her offalong with quite a bit of water. We must go now, he says, or the river will be too high to cross.
Go? Her brows furrow. Go where?
The ark, of course. He casts his gaze desperately around the cottage, looking, I guess, for any supplies he can grab. Noah wants me to bring our goats, but you two can run ahead and
But Father, theyre saying the ark has caused
He shoots me a warning glance nearly as fierce as the weather outside. Dont alarm your mother. Not even Munzir could keep a torch lit in this downpour, and the ark will be safer than this cottage. If we can get there now. Grab what you canblankets, breadand go! Ill tether the goats and catch up.
The ark, safer? Why? Mother asks, but Father is already running out the door. I think of the roof caving in over our heads and decide I dont want to spend one more minute beneath it. I grab a shawl to tie around my head, a blanket and a few extra shifts, and then, impulsively, I reach under my pallet and pull out my bronze knife, tucking it beneath the blue cloth at my waist.
I lead the way to the open doorway, Mother at my heels, and when we step outside she reels back, shocked by the force of the water and wind. I grasp her hand, and she squeezes mine, clutching so hard its as if she needs my support to move forward. Its a strange feelingI dont think either one of us has supported the other in years, more like politely tolerated each others presence and nothing morebut I cant dwell on it now.
The raindrops pelt us with the weight of stones as we go on, the ground beneath our bare feet so slippery we nearly slide down like that cottage roof with every step. Theres another crash, and Mother gasps, squeezing my hand even tighter. I dont even look, not wanting to know whose home has collapsed this time. The only upside is that the villagers are now too distracted to rail on about curses.
Neima! My name twists toward me, swirling on the wind, and my eyes follow the sound to see Arisi fighting her way through the wall of water. Japheth has a hand on her arm, doing his best to support her, but hes also dragging two panicked sheep behind him. I awkwardly shift my bundle of fabric beneath one arm so that, once Arisis close enough, I can grab her free hand in mine. Then, with my mother on one side and Arisi on the other, we head farther into the storm.

***

The ark comes into view gradually before us, its dark form separating by degrees from the clouds surrounding it, until it grows so solid and formidable I can almost believe it is cursed, the cause of this destruction around us, still standing strong while everything else falls. But in spite of this were moving toward the ark, not away, hoping it will offer us some safety. What else can we do?
Before we can reach the ark, though, we have to contend with the river. I have never seen it rise so fast, the water rushing and roiling toward a boil, and already the flat wooden bridge has nearly disappeared beneath its surface. When we begin to cross, the chilly water swirls around my calves, and it reaches almost to Arisis knees, leaving her wobbling and unsteady. But worst of all are the sheep, who tug on their tethers and refuse to set foot in the river, no matter how Japheth yanks them forward. He tries to leave the ewe on the bank and pick up the massive ram, but the ewe bolts for the village and he has to abandon the ram to run after it. It quickly becomes clear Ill have to trust my mother to guide Arisi across, while I go back to help Japheth.
I clutch the ewe tightly as Japheth half carries, half drags the ram across the rising water. The sheeps fleece is so slippery I can barely keep my grasp, but Im afraid if I hold only her tether, shell choke in her struggle to escape me: she wants so badly to run from the river, she fights my hold with a force that almost seems to equal the rain above us. By the time Japheth returns to take her from me, Im gasping for each breath, my heart racing and my arms shaking from my effort.
When I cross the river this time, the water nearly reaches my own knees.
Ive been so focused on my task that not until Im across, and have taken a long moment to catch my breath, do I notice what Mother, Arisi and Japheth are all staring at, wide eyed, slack jawed: a bright red spot of flame burning, impossibly, in the midst of this wet gray world.
Munzir and a few other villagers have wrestled a white tarp over a tree and pinned it to the ground, like one side of an open tent, and beneath it theyve somehow managed to kindle a small fire. Munzir holds a long torch and keeps thrusting it into the flames, but each time he pulls it out, the rain instantly extinguishes it. As if he senses my eyes on him, he turns his face toward mine: the rain has soaked his hair and beard till its black as pitch, black as Kenaans curls; his features twist in fury and hatred, and raindrops settle into each crevice of his skin. What has my family donewhat have I doneto make him hate me so much? Again I find it hard to believe this man is Jorins father. If Jorins expression ever contorts with such viciousness, if his eyes ever turn so dark, I dont know what Ill
Theres a blur of movement behind the fire, a figure stepping out from the back of the clump of villagers. I can barely make out his face, and I certainly cant read his expression, but I know the shade of that hair, golden and distinctive even when its so wet its plastered to his head:
Its Jorin. Hes not holding a torch like his father, like the others gathering close to the fire, but hes there, standing beside them. And that tells me all I need to know.
I scramble to catch up with Mother and Arisi, my heart thudding against my ribcage, my mind whirling like the gusts of air around us. Will they find some way to keep the torches lit? Will they really try to burn down the arkwith us inside it? From the corner of my eye I glimpse sparks of flame moving closer, flying on the wind, and Im not sure whether Im imagining them.
Neima! Im startled to hear a male voice calling and then relieved, a moment later, to see Father dragging our goats behind him. His mouth moves, but most of his words are lost to the storm. Still, he waves the goats tethers toward me, and I know what he wants.
As soon as I take the goats, Father runs for Munzir and his followers. I look between him and the ark, where Mother and Arisi are already stepping inside, while Noah bursts out past them, his long blue and white robe waving in the wind. I need to bring the goats in, but somehow Im frozen again, watching Noah approach the fire with a look of wrath to equal Munzirs on his face.
Why did you not listen? Noah roars out over the tempest of sound. His voice is louder than Ive ever heard it, powerful and assured, no longer the voice of an old man. In fact, it barely seems human. I warned you, he goes on, that God will smite down
A sound so great its not a sound at all, but a force that rends the sky in two and threatens to take the earth with it, blots out the rest of Noahs words. Blots out everythingMunzirs reply and the villagers protests, the pounding of rain against my skin and the air whooshing past my ears, the beating of my heart and the blood moving inside me. For an endless moment, that first clap of thunder is the entire world.
And then time rushes forward again, and with it the rain seems to double its force, making me stumble and knocking the goats to their knees. Some of the villagers are falling, too, hands splaying in the mud as they struggle to right themselves. The lightning comes, then, illuminating this gray world just long enough for us to see Munzirs tarp ripped from the nails that hold it, flung into the sky where it whirls, lost, a white bird too fragile to direct its own course.
In moments, the fire is nothing but a drenched pile of sticks.
Mouths are moving, people must be screaming, the trembling goats beside me must be squealing, but the only sounds left in the world are the crash of water and wind and the boom of thunder. I urge the goats forward, but as soon as they find their footing they slip again, and I do as well. It takes all my attention just to make some slow progress toward the ark, dragging the goats behind me, and I have to narrow my eyes against the increasingly sharp barbs of the raindrops. So I dont even try to see whats going on with my father and Noah, Munzir and the ruined fire. And I dont see the shape approaching me as I stumble onward, till Im only a few steps from the arks open doors
and a cold, wet hand grabs my arm.
Its Jorin, his eyes wide and his lips moving furiously, though I cant make out a single word. I try to pull away from him and he just comes closer, his mouth moving even faster; every minute facet of his expression beseeches me to listen, to understand. Im doing my best to hold on to my anger against him, but its slipping away, a mere gust of hot air that means nothing as the world breaks into pieces around us. And then I no longer care what hes saying; I only want to tell him: Go back, now, while you can still cross the river. I hope your home is strong. Stay safe.
I must be speaking aloud, for Jorins lips have stopped moving and hes leaning even closer, as though he can pluck my words out of the wind. Then a hand grabs my other armFather. He takes the goats tethers from me and pulls me away from Jorin, into the ark. And I let him.
Inside, the sound of rain is, incredibly, even louder. It echoes off the arks surface like a herd of elephants much larger than Bilal and Enise, and it seems to stampede across my very mind, making any attempt at speaking pointless. I cant even hear the creatures who must be wailing in all manner of animal languages. Father pushes me up the ladder to the second floor, while he disappears to deposit the goats somewhere.
Its dark up here as well as loud, and it takes a minute for my vision to adjust well enough to see were all here: Uncle Ham and Aunt Zeda, with Shai curled up and crying beside her; Grandmother Nemzar on Shais other side, stroking her back; my mother huddled in a corner, hands over her face; Japheth holding Arisi. Kenaan is nailing blankets to the windows, which does little to keep out the sideways gusts of rain. A moment later Father reaches the top of the ladder, and then only Noah is missing.
Father has just stepped off of the final rung when a voice booms out, incredibly, over all the other cacophony. Its Noahs voice, that newly powerful, inhuman voice, ringing from the entrance to the ark.
It is come, he says. Then, another noise: the clap of the arks doors closing.
Were shut inside.

Part Two: The Flood

And I say, oh, that I had wings like a dove!
I would fly away and be at rest;
yes, I would wander far away;
I would lodge in the wilderness; Selah
I would hurry to find a shelter
from the raging wind and tempest.

--Psalm 55:6-8

Chapter Six

Time moves strangely up here, in this dark, damp space with the rain beating like a wall of sound around us: thoughts come slowly, but once theyve formed, they hang on tight and refuse to let go. Then theres a struggle, a tussle between one idea and the nexta long moment of emptiness, of blacknessand the next thought takes root.

And the cycle begins again.

Im shivering. Im cold. Im freezing.

Its not cold in hereits stuffy and close and rather humidbut my clothes and hair are soaking wet and refuse to dry. The extra shifts and blankets I grabbed back at homehomeare soaked through as well.

Arisi is shivering too. So is my mother.

Aunt Zeda has blankets. Dry blankets. She brought them to the ark several days ago. Kenaan is nailing some of them over the windows, but the rain still gusts in. Its freezing. Im freezing.

Aunt Zeda will share her blankets, but only since we know its her generosity that warms us. Her forethought we should be thankful for. I can tell all this from the way her mouth moves, though I hear only the pounding rain.

Not so cold anymore. But still clammy. If the men werent here, Id peel this ruined, mud-splattered shift off me right now. Will I have to sleep here, in the same room as Grandfather Noah and Uncle Ham and Japheth? As Kenaan?

Light. Sickly lemon light shoots through the window, and by the time I realize its there, its gone again. Extinguished like Munzirs fire.

Lightning. And the ark is so tall, taller than the highest cedar tree in our village. And at its center rises that deck house, and its pointed roof.

Grandfather Noah is descending the ladder from the deck house right now. Theres another flash of light, and I catch his grimace of pain as he bends and extends his knees, as though his old joints pain him. His hands tremble so badly he can barely keep hold of the rungs, but finally 
he reaches the foot of the ladder. He speaks to my father, but Father shakes his head, leans closer, his ear nearly against Noahs mouth.

Noah is an old man again. Gone is the voice powerful enough to cut through thunder, the arms strong enough to wrench closed massive ark doors. Hes just like the rest of us. Human.

Father is crouching beside Mother now, speaking into her ear.

Mother has shifted closer to me. With one hand cupped over her mouth, she screams into my ear, and still her words are like leaves trampled and torn under the weight of the rain, a few of them lost to the wind. Father saysworrywatch for firesafe.

Father and Uncle Ham have followed Noah up the ladder to the deck house. I suppose theyre watching for lightning, for a fire, so they can get us out in time.

But Father saysworry echoes against my ears, just beneath the rhythm of the falling rain.

My clothes are almost dry. Time must be passing.

I hope the men managed to feed all the animals this morning.

Smell is nearly as powerful as sound. Its finally dawning on me why my stomach feels so wretchedand why Im not hungry, though I havent eaten since this morning. I should really go clean up some of that animal waste.

Ive been curled up against the side of the ark so long my muscles throb. Why do I feel like I shouldnt move? Theres no logical reason not to get up and go check on the animals. Its not as if the storm can see me through the arks walls, as if my moving will catch the rain and wind and lightnings attention and bring their fury down upon us.

But thats how it feels.

I dont think Im alone in this strange notion, either: aside from the men whove taken turns watching from the deck house, none of us have moved since we wrapped ourselves in Zedas blanketswhathours ago? Even Kenaan has just been sitting here, not even jiggling his foot as far as I can tell, since he finished securing the windows.

Surely we cant stay like this much longer. It will get even darker soon. What will we do when we have to relieve ourselves? I cant believe Im trapped here like this, so close to Kenaan

But whats happening to everyone outside?

I cant think about that now. Not when this endless clamor has begun to feel like a series of nails driving their way through my skull.

At least Im not shivering anymore.

I hope the animals are all right.

That odor really is awful.

In the end its Aunt Zeda who organizes things and gets us moving, first shouting into her husbands ear and then my fathers and Japheths, then yanking me and Arisi, my mother and Grandmother Nemzar and Shai up from our places on the floor, one by one.

I realize she cant just ask us to stand and follow her, at least not without screaming herself hoarse, but Im still irritated when she tugs my elbow a bit more sharply than necessary.

Aunt Zeda leads us into the next room, where sacks of grain and other supplies line one wall like a mound of solid shadows. My eyes have adjusted well enough that I can see Zeda rooting around for an empty bucket, placing it in a corner, struggling to hang a blanket from the rafters, finally giving up and running for Kenaan, who nails the blanket into place.

Once Kenaan leaves the room, I can at last admit that, yes, I need to relieve myself. Badly.

With that done, I join Mother, Grandmother and Arisi in arranging blankets against one wall of the ark. It seems were going to sleep in here and the men in the other room, closer to the deck house.

It also seems were running out of blankets.

Aunt Zeda unearths some of our over-baked bread and a few full water skins just in time: in moments, a new darkness descends, one so deep I can barely make out the shape of my own hand.

Someone presses a hunk of bread into my palm, and since I dont know what else to do with it, I eat it.

Then my throat is coated with sawdust, so when someone passes me a water skin, I drink.

Then theres nothing to do but curl up against the wall and pretend to sleep.

***

It begins in the middle of the night, or perhaps the early morning. My stomach lurches. The blood inside me lurches. My bones lurch. And then I realize the movements not inside me at all. The floor is lurching, tipping, angling to one side just the smallest bit. Im not even sure how I know this, as I huddle in this pitch darkness, unmoving, unseeing, though not unhearingno, the pounding of the rain is relentless. But somehow my body senses the change around me. My mind and my useless eyes and ears and all my limbs scramble to find a new equilibrium, but all that frenzy inside me just leaves me even dizzier. And then theres the ba-rum, ba-rum of my heartbeat, so forceful its almost painful. Its fear that makes my heart so strong and so heavyfear of what that tilting floor might mean. I wish I could tell whether the others were awake, could ask Arisi what shes thinking. I almost wish the lightning would return, if it meant I could see whats going on, even for an instant.
Another lurch. If someone screamed, would I hear it? If I screamed, would I hear it?
Theres nothing to do but wait. I clench my jaw, my shoulders, my fists, focus on the sensation of my fingernails digging into my palms, and wait
And wait
And wait

A body smacking into mine wrenches me out of half sleep. It must be morning; just enough light leaks in for me to make out Arisis delicate features beside me. Her eyes are stretched wide, one hand clutching my arm and the other on her stomach, as we slide farther and hit Mother on my other side. I hear her cry of shockits a loud cry, but still, the rain must have abated a littleand then were shifting back, in the opposite direction, and Aunt Zeda gives a shrill protest as Arisi knocks against her. Its all so strange and ridiculous, Im not sure whether to scream or laugh. Or pinch myself and hope that I wake up safe at home, that this is all a mad dream brought on by Noahs ravings.
But my stomach is sloshing around inside me as though its being tugged in threeno, fourdirections at once, and I realize that in addition to the sideways lurching, the floor is rocking forward and backward a bit. And I know this is no dream, for no dream could force such bile to my throat and leave me whirling, dizzy and faint, untethered from the ground yet held in place by the discomfort inside me.
And then it gets worse: my stomach is rising now, forcing itself up through my chest, toward my throat, blocking my airway as I try to breathe through the nearly unbearable sensation
a moment of nothingness, of pure, weightless relief
and my stomach slams back down, hard, with an explosion of pain like stars. I try to rise, to make it to the bucket in the corner but Im stumbling, tripping over myself and it makes me feel even worse, and then the sounds and smells around me tell me the others arent making it to the bucket either, and then I give up.

***

Somehow we trek the impossible distance across the floor that shifts in all directions beneath us, through the open doorway, back to the room with the ladders, where the men slept. Theyre awake too. And as sick as we are.

***

That rising-falling feeling happens again and again, both inside and outside our bodies, as we sit orin most caseslie flat on the floor against the wall. After Father manages the climb to the deck house and back down again, he confirms what we already know: its the sensation of water lifting us, lifting the ark off the ground. Id refuse to believe him if I could, but the ark wont let meit wont stop rocking and rolling backward and forward, to one side and the other, buffeted by the wind above and the water below.
Is there any dry land left at all? I glance to the windows above me, but even lifting my head makes the room spin around me, and rising to my feet seems out of the question. Besides, the windows are so high Id barely be able to see out even if I stood on tiptoe, and Father says all you can see from that angle is clouds and rain, anywayyou have to climb to the deck house for a clear view.
And none of us seem capable of making that journey again right now, not even Father.
I remind myself how much worse Arisi must feel, with her swollen stomach: she has her own bucket beside her now, and it seems shes barely lifted her head from it in an hour. And poor crying Shai, who is far too young to deal with this. And then there are all the people outside the ark. But to tell the truth, though it shames me to admit it, at this moment nothing seems to exist outside my own heaving stomach, my shaking limbs, my throbbing head. Ive been sick to my stomach before, when I ate something that disagreed with me, and once, as a child, I lay ill for nearly a week with a terrible fever. But Ive never experienced a sickness like this before, a pain that roots itself at the bottom of my gut and radiates outward till Im sure I cant stand it for one moment longer. I dont think any of us have experienced this before.
The world outside is no more than a fever dream.

***

The animals arent getting fed for a while. And nothings getting cleaned up. Well just have to put up with the smell.

***

Time passes.

***

The rainor perhaps just the wind that drives it against the ark with such forcehas calmed further, and the thunder is gone for the time being, but I almost wish they would return. For now we can hear the animals. Such a confusion of moans and roars, whines and growls, grumbles and bellows, at once pitiful and terrifying. The creatures must be sick too. And frightened. And hungry.
Uncle Ham and Father finally rise to deal with the animals that will no longer be ignored, but they clutch their stomachs and move slowly, unsteadily. Japheth should go with them, but he wont leave Arisis side for a moment, and Kenaanwell, I think Kenaan is the sickest of all of us. Hes been moaning like a child for so long now, Ive lost track of which cries are his amid all the animal protests around us. Once Father and Ham are up, I try to stand as wellI want to help, and to check on the elephantsbut even lifting my head and shoulders from the blanket beneath me forces my stomach toward my throat again. I cant bear the thought of retching once more on an empty stomach, so I allow myself to fall back to the floor.
As Father nears the ladder down to the lower level, he bends over, suddenly, so his back is nearly parallel to the floor, his shoulders creeping inward, and he stands frozen like that for a long, excruciating moment. I cant bear to see him appear so vulnerable, in such pain, just like the rest of us. I remember him at the smithy when I was a child, transforming burning-hot metal into weapons and tools with an ease that seemed like magic, and I think he should somehow be above the weakness that has struck the rest of our family.
Finally he recovers himself and straightens, and I let out the breath Ive been holding. Then he disappears down the ladder, with Uncle Ham behind him.

***

I watch Noah out of the corner of my eye. Hes sitting up, and hes not groaning or grasping his stomach, but taut lines run across his face, from the corners of his mouth to his jawline, from his eyes to his temples, as though holding in his pain takes all the effort he possesses. I wonder if his God told him this sickness was coming, if theres some secret purpose behind it too vast for our human minds to comprehend.
Thinking of such things is far too difficult. Thinking at all is far too difficult.

***

Some of the animal noises are coming not from below, but from our own level, from the rooms past the one where we slept last night: squeaks and caws, coos and whistles. Shai pesters Kenaan until he admits he put all the birds he trapped up here. In the same room as the reptiles.
I wish for the rain to drown everything out once more.

***

By the time Father and Uncle Ham return, Aunt Zeda has wrestled up more bread and water. She says eating will make us feel better, but I think she just relishes the chance to order the rest of us around. I only manage a few bites before my stomach rebels, and the water tastes like old metal and something rancidor perhaps thats just the taste permanently lodged at the back of my throat.
At least Father tells me the animals are all right. Frightened and distressed, but all right.

***

As darkness begins to creep its way back into the ark, we women go back to the room where we slept last night. We make our way on hands and knees, like animals ourselvesall of us except Aunt Zeda, that is, who appears to have a stomach made of metal. I wonder why we bothered to move in the first place.
When Ive managed another trip to the bucket in the corner and collapsed on my blanket, I decide I wont make the mistake of moving again.

Chapter Seven

Ive been enclosed within these four cedar-wood walls for an eternity. A lifetime. Lifetimes. I think whats worst of all is being able to hear and feel whats going on outside, but not to see it, not to know. Its like walking around with a thick, itchy wool cloth pressed tight against my eyes. Except Im still not doing much walking.
Id swear my ears have grown more sensitive, though, and out of the cacophony of birdcalls from the room beside us, one in particular seems to pierce though me. Its a low cooing, smooth and hollow and somehow unbearably sad, that sounds a bit like the reed pipes Deryas father used to play. Even through the higher, more demanding chirps and squeals, I recognize that call: a doves song.
Kenaans been feeding the birds since he recovered a bit from his sickness, and Ive been staying away as much to avoid him as the reptiles. But right now Kenaan is with his parents, grumbling about his stomach again, and I decide I must find that dove. I cant ignore its cries of distress any longer.
I rise slowly, painfully, with one hand against the wall to brace myself, and as I move toward the bird room I keep my hand on the wood. If I let go I would surely fall, for the floor still tips in all directions. Its mainly just a slight rocking, but every few steps I take, an alarming lurch threatens to send me sprawling across the ark. Then I have to stop, leaning both hands against the wall, as I wait for my spinning head and stomach to recover.
It seems to take hours, but at last Im close enough to the bird room to make out a new sound: a dull, repetitive thud that echoes inside me, as if my bones are knocking against each other. I force myself to move faster, but then I hear a shrill voice call, Slow down!
I turn my head to find Shai following behind me. Wait for me, she cries, trailing one hand against the wall like Ive been doing as she tiptoes forward. Im tempted to tell her walking on her toes will only make her feel worse, but her brow is furrowed in such intense concentration, I dont want to distract her. She looks almost like a phantom, her limbs twig-like and bony, face pale and bloodless and nearly yellow; her hair is half plaited, half just a birds nest of knots, and her shift is dirty and torn. The sight of her makes something wrench inside me, but I know I look much the same. We all do.
We head together into the bird room, where Im relieved to see the reptile cages are all against one wall and easily avoided. Clearly Noah hasnt visited here, or wed have heard his grumblings: I doubt Kenaans rounded up every type of snake and lizard in our village, much less in the world. And I count very few insects among the paltry row of cages. No butterflies, of course, for how could Kenaan catch a creature so delicate? I have a sudden longing to see one of those beautiful, pale blue butterflies that flock around the red azalea bushes in the spring. It would flit through the ark, graceful and sure and free of the sickness that plagues us earthbound creatures, its wings the color of a cloudless summer sky
But Im forgetting why Im here. And the thud, thud that accompanies the doves cooing grows ever more insistent. The birdcages are scattered through the room in a jumbled mess, most of them far from any wall that might keep them from slipping and sliding with the pitch of the ark. No wonder the birds are so frightened.
Shai and I have to let go of the wall ourselves to pick through the cagesno hawks or eagles, I notice, despite Kenaans bragging that hed trap oneuntil we reach the source of all the racket, and I suck in a sharp breath. One of the doves is flinging itself against the bars of its cage, over and over, though its left wing droops at an awkward angle and it must be in terrible pain. Its mate sits at the back of the cage, head tucked to its breast, seemingly indifferent.
I kneel and open the cage, but when I reach inside the doves frenzy increases. SheI have no way of knowing, but it seems like a shedoes her best to flee my hand, scooting backward and trying to lift herself on her injured wing. She only makes it a hands breadth from the ground before falling again. I take a deep breath before grabbing the bird around her middle and pulling her from the cage. Im shocked by the warmth of her body and the strength of her rabid heartbeat, hitting against the barrier of her bones again and again the same way she threw her entire body against the bars.
I lower myself all the way to the floor and sit with crossed legs, placing the dove on my lap, and she calms a bituntil I try to examine her injured wing. Then her cries become higher and even more panicked, her entire body shakes, and she tries to flee me again. We have to bind her wing, I tell Shai, or it will never heal, with the way she keeps struggling. Can you get me some clotha blanket, maybe?
Shai nods, wide eyed, and hurries off as though the rocking floor no longer bothers her. I realize I too have forgotten my own tender stomach, now that Im focused on the dove. Still, it seems far too long before Shai returns, clutching a drooping wool blanket and breathing hard. I hand Shai the bird and she sits, stroking the doves white and brown-dappled feathers, as I set to tearing strips off the blanket. But my arms are weakIve barely eaten these past few days, after alland the fabric is unyielding. Well, what else could I have expected from a blanket Zeda wove?
I glance around to make sure no one else has wandered in, and then I pull my carving knife from beneath my now very bedraggled blue cloth belt, where Ive kept it since I first stepped onto the ark. I couldnt exactly tuck it under my blanket at night, after all, unless I wanted to risk it sliding its way across the ark.
Shai gasps when she catches sight of the bronze blade, gleaming even in this dull, muted light. Where did you
Shh, I shush her, dont tell your parents, all right?
I wont. She bites her lip and looks down at the dove again, her dark eyes serious and tender.
With the help of my sharp blade, the fabric parts easily as a fallen leaf in a childs hand. Strangely, I have the urge to dig the knife into something harder, to form the doves shape out of wood and see if I can capture the soft slope of her feathers. Surely there could not be a worse time or place to practice my carving, and besides, Ive given up that pointless habit. But my thoughts are not so sensible.
My thoughts dont rule my actions, though, and I set aside my foolish desire as I focus on tearing the blanket into even strips. I take the dove from Shai and wrap the cloth gently but firmly around her injured wing, hoping it will hold the fragile bones in place. Shh, shh, I soothe her, trying to convince myself as well as the bird that I know what Im doing. When I lift my hands for a moment, I see she can still move the muscles where her wing connects to her bodyin fact, shes frantically twitching there, trying to lift the wing and fly. So I wrap another strip of cloth over the wing and then under the doves belly, over her back, twice, three times, till Ive reached the end of the strip and tied it to the other pieces of cloth. Now shes not able to move that wing at all, and her shrill coos have dulled to a whimper. Im sorry, I whisper, and hesitate before adding, Im sorry, Aliye. The name means high one, and I mean it as a promise, or at least a hope, that one day shell fly high again.
I ask Shai to open the cage door so I can return Aliye, but as soon as Ive closed the door behind her, the bird lets out the most woeful, pitiful, pathetic cry of a coo you could ever imagine. She wants out! Shai says. She wants to be held!
She didnt seem so happy to be held before, I grumble. I think shes just too smart, and she knows now she has a name she can demand special treatment.
Even before Ive finished speaking, Aliye has begun throwing her body against the bars once more. She may not be able to move her wing any longer, but it will never heal if she keeps abusing it like that. Too smart, I mutter again. I reach for the dove once more, and she quiets. Already she seems to be growing used to my armsor perhaps she just prefers them to the cage.
Still, navigating the ark proves much more difficult while holding an injured bird, and Id swear the floors swaying has grown even stronger. By the time Ive made it back to my blanket, Im so dizzy and exhausted that I nearly collapse onto the floor.

***

I wake from a dream of blue butterflies and white birds to my fathers gruff voice. Daughter, he says, has your stomach settled? I open my eyes to find him peering down at me, his own eyes wide with hope even as his mouth closes tight, the taut curve of it grim and worried and perhaps even resentful. As I wake fully I realize my mothers sitting upright beside me, her own expression stern. Please your father, that look says.
So I sit up and answer, Yes, Father, I am much better, though my gut sends up a wave of protest at the lie.
Good. He sighs, his gaze straying to the dove perched in her own nest of a blanket beside me. I know he sees the bird, but he makes no comment, saying only, Nahala, my wife, and Neima, my daughterWhy is he being so formal? Hes procrastinating, I decide, putting off what he doesnt want to sayI know you arehave beenill, and I hate to ask this of you. But we need your help. There are too many animals to care for, and the smell below has become unbearable. If we could just clean up some of that animal waste
Of course, Father, I say, with a twinge of guilt that Ive been neglecting my duties and, if I hadnt been prodded, would have continued to do so.
But Father shakes his head, puts a hand up to stop me, and goes on, I never thought Id have to ask my wife and daughter to work when youre unwell, but
I sigh. He is so good, and it only makes me feel worse.
but your uncles and grandfather and I must spend our time working on the ark itself, checking the walls and shoring up the weak spots. Even the smallest leak could be devastating. Im sorry
Now Im perplexed. Surely we could deal with one little leak. And how can there be weak spots, with all the work youve done? Fathers face turns harder, and, unaccountably, my heart beats faster. In any case, in a few days the waters will recede, right? Im rambling, but I cant stop. And well be able to leave
Neima! my mother says sharply, dont question your father.
I barely hear her, though, for Fathers face has gone harder still, and paler, till it resembles a weathered stone: hes realized hes said too much. My body feels heavy, as though the ark really has sprung a leak and its sinking, fast, and pulling me down with it. Without a word, I stand and head for the room next door, for the ladder to the deck house, fighting to keep my steps sure and steady.
Neima, what are you Mother calls at the same moment as Father says, I dont think thats a good id
But then Arisi and Shai, both of whom have been listening to our entire exchange, rise to follow me, and chaos erupts. Arisi, you cant! Japheth calls, while Aunt Zeda flies in like a whirlwind from the far corner of the room and yanks Shai back.
I want to see! Shai whines, and I turn back toward her. As Zeda hangs impatiently above us, I kneel so my eyes are level with Shai and whisper so only she can hear me:
I need you to stay here and watch Aliye, all right? Shell be scared if we both leave. Shai narrows her eyes almost shrewdlyshe knows Im putting her off. But after chewing her lip for a moment, she turns back toward the dove.
Arisi and Japheth are still bickering as we near the ladder, and my earlier guilt and fear is turning to frustration. What are the men keeping from us, and what makes them think they have the right to do so? You would treat your wife like a child, I ask Japheth, when she is carrying your own babe even now?
Im only trying to keep her safe! Japheth says as Arisi pushes past both of us.
You dont have to talk about me like Im not here, she snaps, grabbing the ladder with tightly clenched hands.
Shem, Japheth asks my father, will you allow this?
Theyll have to know eventually. Fathers voice is defeated, but I refuse to look at him. Hes right: I have to know.
Japheth shoots me a glare as he helps Arisi up the ladder and I follow behind. Well, I mutter under my breath, its not like one trip up a ladder will make her lose the baby.
Im relieved that neither Mother nor Father climbs the ladder, but Im equally relievedthough I wont let Japheth know sothat Im not up here alone. Inside the deck house, the windows are still too high for me to see much, so I throw open the door and step out into the rain and the wind. The sudden chill rolls through me, refreshing at first, but as I draw closer to the edge of the deck the drop in temperature feels increasingly sinister.
And then Im at the railing, clutching the wood barrier so tight the flesh of my palms burns, but still Im falling, or maybe floatingcertainly Im not on solid ground any longer, for there is no solid ground and the world is upside down. The sky is below us, a thick liquid swirl thats not blue or black or gray, green or brown or white, but somehow all of these colors at once. Mostly its just one dark mass that blends seamlessly into the clouds and falling rain above it, so that there seems to be no distinction between what is overhead and what is beneath us. But I know, in the churning pit of my stomach, that whats below is not a cloudy sky but water, water that extends in all directions, farther than the eye can see, water with no end and no bottom, water that my mind rejects as impossible even as my eyes insist it is there before me.
Japheth and Arisi approach the railing beside me, but I barely register their presence, for Ive begun to make out the things in the water, tossing and turning on the endless waves, adding the glints of colors within the blue-gray. I see branches with a few bedraggled leaves still hanging on, entire tree trunks, and even, at the end of one trunk, a mass of roots that must have been torn forcibly from the ground. I see glints of straw atop mud-brick slabs that must once have been roofs, or walls. I see broken clay pots and wooden barrels, long, torn strips of leather that might once have covered tents, and bloated masses of fur that I fear arewereanimals, though Im loathe to look too close.
And then something drifts close to the ark, something that looks like a tangled clump of long black hairand then, when the water tosses the dark strands to one side, an unnaturally white, thick column that might be a necka neck connecting to a shoulder and down a bloated arm to the monstrously swollen, ravaged extremity that was once a hand and fingers. And then I close my eyes.
I want to retch, to expel the mass of fear and confusion and revulsion that has gathered inside me, but my body wont allow me that relief. Eyes still closed, I hear Japheth say, in a voice so quiet its a wonder I can hear him over the rain, Weve drifted far from our village. The homes and possessions andand bodies you see do not belong to anyone we know.
But what Japheth says doesnt matter, for whether I can see their bodies or not, I know theyre all dead. Jorin. Derya. Old Hannah, whose house was the first to collapse in the storm. All the women who used to gossip about our family at the river. All the children who laughed and danced in the first raindrops. Munzir, even. But most of all, Jorin. Derya. Derya. When the last thing I said to her The last thing she said to me
I snip off that train of thought and immediately confront another, almost equally horrifying one: all thisthe storm, the flood, the deathmeans Noahs one God is real. Doesnt it? How else could my grandfather have predicted this disaster? But noI cant believe it. For how could one God cause so much destruction? How could one God hold mastery over the clouds and rain, wind and thunder, over the lives of every living creature upon the earth, both animal and human? And if a God did create all this, did control the worlds fate, why would he choose to destroy it?
Evil, something whispers within my mind. Noah said God wanted to rid the world of evil, of mans wickedness. Wickedness like that of the bandits who attacked and stole from Grandfather, who left Grandmother Nemzar violated and bleeding. But not all people are wicked. Surely not those children who rejoiced in the falling rain, who took pleasure in and gave thanks for the earths bounty. Surely not Derya, who stood up for me so many times, and not mischievous but kind, kind Jorin. And even those members of our village who could be cruel, or petty, or power thirsty, like Munzir and his followersnot even they deserved to die.
My eyes are open now, but I stare into the gray expanse without seeing; the world is only a reflection of my own dark, whirling thoughts. For if this vengeful God does existand Im still not sure he does, despite all the evidence before mewhy would he choose to save our family and no other? We are not so pure, so different from those who have perished. I myself have wished Noah dead, have wished that my mother were kinder, that Ham had chosen a different wife and that Kenaan were not my cousin
But perhaps our family is not saved at all. I look out at the rolling waves and wonder if this God might be toying with us, tossing and turning us like those waves, prolonging our suffering before we too are destroyed. After all, how long can we survive in this watery world before our food runs out, or the ark leaks, or some other disaster befalls us?
Perhaps It takes a moment for me to realize the voice comes not from my thoughts, but from Arisi beside me. Perhaps she starts again, and it sounds as though all the breath has been torn from her, the same way my own voice sounds in my head. it is not the whole world. Perhaps there is dry land just beyond our sight, with people and animals walking upon it; perhaps the sun is even shining there. Arisis words would seem too full of false hope, too sickly sweet, like a meal made entirely of honey, were it not for the quaver in her voice. And besides, shes right: the world extends far beyond what we can see, and we have no way of knowing or predicting what exists outside our small corner of existence. The trader with his stories of animals too strange to imagine is proof enough of that.
But all these impossible questions are making my head spin. I suppose the world has always been a mystery too vast to take in at once, but now, with such darkness and danger above and below us, it seems that way more than ever. So Im almost relieved to hear the clomping, impatient footsteps of my father coming to retrieve us. At least I think its Father
until I turn to face Uncle Ham, lugging a large wooden bucket in each hand. As long as youre up here, he says, you can fetch some water. Im not sure whether hes addressing me or Japheth, but I know Japheth will want both hands free to help Arisi down the ladder, so I grab one of the buckets by its handle. Then I find myself staring dumbly at it, wondering if Ham means for me to stand here waiting while it fills with rain. It feels strange and difficult and somehow wrong to set my mind to mundane tasks after what Ive seen.
Over here, Ham continues, his voice rough and unsympatheticor perhaps thats only an effect of the warping wind. He walks across the deck to a huge wood barrel that seems somehow bolted to the floor and must hold ten buckets worth of rainwater. Just one more example of Noahs foreknowledge of this disaster. It would make me sick, if I werent already.
I fill my bucket and make my way back inside the deck house and down the ladder, a difficult task on wobbling legs. As soon as Im within the ark, Father rushes forward to take the bucket from me, but I shake my headI wont let him do my work any longer. I head for the next ladder down to the lower level, and I realize my mother, Aunt Zeda, and even Shai are preparing to accompany me, along with most of the men. Noah, Father, and Uncle Ham all shout instructions at once, and their voices form one dizzying swirl:
Buckets and shovels for cleaning are against the right-hand wall. Keep the water buckets separate from the waste containers
Dont approach the flesh-eatersKenaan and Japheth can handle that
Just bring the refuse up here and well toss it over the side
Make sure to ration the animal feedespecially the meat
The voices fade as I descend farther, into a smell so thick and noxious it seems to hold weight. The stench pounds against my body, trying to force me back up the ladder, and the shaking in my legs and even my arms increases. I barely make it to the floor before I drop the bucket, lean over, and retch the last meager contents of my stomach.
Just one more thing for me to clean up.

***

Its darker down here, where there are no windowsthe water must be battering against the walls right beside me, a thought that makes me shiver in my still-damp shiftand my vision takes some time to adjust. My ears too need a moment to recover from the onslaught of animal noises, which gradually fades into an ever-present background that I can almost shut out, if Im determined enough. The smell, thoughtheres no shutting that out, and breathing through my mouth is almost worse, for then I can taste the foul odor in the back of my throat.
My water bucket is empty before Ive made it through a single row of cages, so I join my mother, Aunt Zeda and Shai at the right-hand wall. Along with the others, I grab a shovel and a smaller bucket, one of the ones designated for waste material; then we spread out and set to the odious task of collecting animal dung. I can tell Shai wants to follow me, but Zeda grabs her arm and leads her in the opposite direction. Its just as wellif she asked me what I saw on deck, Id have no idea what to tell her.
Father told us to stay away from the meat-eaters, but when I make out the tigers telltale growl amid the din, it somehow draws me closer. That feral sound seems to encapsulate everything Ive just witnessed up above: a world turned dark and dangerous, savage and incomprehensible. So I follow the low rumble till Im standing only a hands breadth before the tigers cage, its amber eyes aimed right at mine, two dim flames in the dusky air. Though still massive, the creature now seems more bones than muscle as it paces slowly, deliberately back and forth, back and forth, letting out that desperate snarl all the while. Why? its eyes ask me. Why? its rumble of a voice demands. But its answers I want, not more questions, so I just shake my head and walk away.
Soon I reach the young lions, and I wonder whether Father wants me to stay away from them as well. Probably, but after all Ive seen today, two baby animals just dont seem like much of a threat. Besides, Im not sure the poor things can even move. Theyre lying on their sides, letting out little mewls of discomfort, and their cage floor reeks with the sticky remnants of vomit. As I open the door and step insidethe lions dont even seem to register my presenceI realize the vomit really is only remnants, residueas though the creatures have eaten it and licked the floor nearly clean. No wonder theyre so miserable.
As I continue through the cages, I find that many of the animals have eaten their own vomit, their droppings, or both. Im torn between a kind of reliefits less mess for us to deal withand worry. The animals must be so hungry, and Im afraid their eating habits might make them sicker, or at least prolong the discomfort caused by the rocking ark. Im amazed to realize that I myself must actually be adjusting to the constant movementstanding and walking and working is making me feel better, not worse.
I make two trips back up the ladder with full buckets of animal waste, and on the second I take the refuse up to the deck myself, along with an empty water bucket. I want to fill an entire bucket just for the elephants, whom I havent seen yettheyre fenced all the way in that back corner, after all.
When Ive nearly made it back to the elephants, I start to worry that they wont remember me, or worse, that theyll somehow blame me for trapping them in this miserable place. Im trapped too, I remind myself. Still, Im relieved when I hear a welcoming trumpet call and see two gray trunks waving in my direction. Once Im close enough, Enise and Bilal tickle my face as I dump the water in their trough, and then they quickly abandon me to slurp the water up their trunks and spill it into their mouths. They drink greedily, almost desperately, and dont waste a single drop by throwing it on their backs or into my face as they did before. In moments the trough is empty again, and this makes me as sad as anything Ive seen today. I know my reactions illogical, perhaps unforgivableso many people dead, including my best friend, and Im worried about two elephantsbut I cant help the way I feel.
Setting down the empty bucket, I take Bilals trunk in my hands and examine the newly cracked, dry edges. Your name doesnt fit so well anymore, does it? I ask, and both Bilal and Enise turn their wondering full-moon eyes toward me.
I look away, unable to bear their gazes, and something just outside the elephants pen catches my attention. I stoop down to pick it up: a piece of wood Japheth must have left behind when he built this fence. Its bigger than the remnants I usually carve, but if I attempted to recreate these elephants out of wood, it would be the perfect size
No. What am I thinking? I cast the wood piece down and rub both Enise and Bilal on their broad foreheads. Its getting darker, and Ill have to leave them soon. I have no desire to maneuver past tigers and wolves and jackals in pitch blackness, even if the animals are caged. I give Enise one last pat and turn to go, but a trunk pokes me between the shoulder blades. No, waita trunk wouldnt have such a sharp edge.
I swivel back around and find Bilal holding the wood piece in his trunk, offering it to me. I shake my head. You keep it. His eyes turn down in what looks like disappointment, and I give him another pat on the head as well. But thank you, I add under my breath as I finally walk away.
On my way back to the ladder, I catch sight of two more scraps of wood: one by an open doorway, with a long, slender shape that reminds me of the flower-birds; then a thicker, more solid, somehow muscular piece by the tigers cage. Odd, but Im too exhausted by this point to think much of it.

***

Back on the second level, I return to the womens room to see twin spots of flame piercing through the darkness, an echo of the tigers eyes below. Zeda has lit two of her oil lamps
and shes drawn Noah in here to fuss with her. Youll set the ark aflame! he protests, whirling so the ends of his long robe fly out. If anything catches fire, it will be his trailing garment. Ive always hated that robe, with the musty scent that clings to it even through the driest months.
Were going to be here awhile, Zeda snaps back, and you cant expect us to go on when we cant see our own hands before our faces! So she knows whats happening outside as well. And while she may have the strongest stomach of all of us, it appears her mind is not so sturdy: she must be truly distraught, if she dares to challenge Noah. Shes spent so many years flattering her father-in-law, and now she risks undoing all her work in one moment. If Ham finds out what shes done, hell be furious.
Husband. Nemzar speaks softly, soothingly, as she approaches and places a hand on Noahs arm. Were all beyond bedraggled, but she still looks somehow beautiful in the low lamplight, the hints of red in her hair flickering along with the flame. Well be careful. We could all use a little light.
Noah just harrumphs, but he walks away without insisting Aunt Zeda extinguish the flames. He stops in the corner where Japheth and Arisi are tucked together, whispering, and clears his throat. Your wife may be unable to work, Noah grouses, but you, Japheth, have no excuse for lazing about. We need you on deck. Then, without waiting for a response, he storms off, his robe fluttering behind him.
Im still standing near the doorway, and Noah brushes right past me on his way out of the room, so close I can hear him grumbling under his breath, can see the slight tremors in his hands that he does his best to hide. Yet he doesnt acknowledge my presence; Im not sure he sees me at all.
Aliye the dove, on the other hand, certainly does recognize my presenceand shes not quiet about it. As I approach she coos so frantically, youd think she was trapped in a cage again, and she hops up and down on her crumpled blanket as if she just cant understand why her wings no longer hold her aloft. Shh, I scold her as I drop down onto my own blanket. Luckily Zeda and Nemzar are too deep in conversation to notice; Mother does, but she just shakes her head and looks away, leaning against the ark wall.
Aliye quiets when I place a finger on her sleek but trembling head, and we sit for a moment in silenceor rather what feels like silence, for the drum of rain on the roof and the echo of animal noises from below have become so familiar, I no longer hear them. I watch Grandmother and Zeda attempting to scrounge up some food for us, with Shai hanging behind them. Japheth finally stands to leave, but hes taking his time about it, like a sullen child reluctant to obey his fathers orders. And then my mother speaks.
Whatwhat was it like out there?
Im surprised. Its not like Mother to rely on others when she can do something herself, and surely Father wouldnt object to her going on deck after the rest of us have. Why dont you go up and see? I ask.
She reaches for a nearby blanket, grips it in two tight fists, and closes her eyes. Im not as brave as you are.
Now Im not just surprised, but shocked. Has my mother actually complimented me? Im not Its just As I stammer, it occurs to me that perhaps Mothers comment is more criticism than praise. I did defy Father, after all. Im only curious, I finish, my voice fading to a mumble.
Just tell me, she says, eyes still closed, tension rising in taut lines from her fists up her arms. I dont want to see, but I need to know.
So I do. But as I speak, I look away from her squeezed-shut eyelids, toward the dove with her wide-open eyes. I study themtwo flame-colored rings around black pupilstill they eclipse all visions of the world outside. When Im done, Mother says nothing, and I realize I have a question for her as well. Do you know how long weve been here?
In some ways it feels like years have passed since we stepped onto the ark, and in others it seems that only moments ago I stood on parched earth, dreaming of rain.
This is the fifth day, Mother says, in a voice as cracked and dry as the earth I remember with something like longing.
I glance around me; Nemzar, Zeda and Shai are still occupied with our dismal supply of food, while Arisi sits and stares blankly into a corner. No ones paying me any attention, so I turn to face the ark wall and pull my carving knife from my belt. Mother lets out the first hint of a protest but quickly stifles it.
I dig the knife into the wood much deeper than necessary, once, twice, again and again and again, until five jagged lines march their way across the wall. One for each day since the world ended.


Chapter Eight

Derya and I are seven years old, collecting fleece with the other children as the entire village shears sheep. A tuft of wool flies out of nowhere, landing atop Deryas gleaming black hair, and I cant help but laughthen another tuft sails right into my open mouth. Deryas eyes turn a bright, piercing green as she searches out our tormentors. My own gaze darts toward Kenaan and Jorin, but both are straight-faced, focused on their task. We stare at the boys, and a moment later, Jorins mouth tugs toward a satisfied smileand we tear small hunks of wool from the nearest clump of fleece and pelt them at the boys. They counter our attack, and the world dissolves into a soft white rain
the air darkens, cools, and Derya and I are leaning against the wall of her hut as evening falls, listening to her father play his pipes. The melody dips and rises like a birds wings buoyed on the wind, lulling us toward sleep, and Derya leans her head on my shoulder. I close my eyes
and we are fourteen. Derya laughs and spins so her skirts fly around her and her black braid swings. She is so beautiful, already several young men of the village have spoken to her father, but she wants Kenaan. Thats why shes spinning in circles now, laughing at nothing in the middle of the day, in the middle of our choresshes caught sight of Kenaan passing by, and she hopes to lure him closer. I just stand there, watching her till my own head spins
spins and spins and spins, the whole world spinning in a blur of blues and greens so vivid I can taste them
and out of the whirlpool of color comes Derya, sixteen now, looking just as she did only days ago, by the river. Her long, slender arms reach for me, her mouth open in a wide smile. She speaks, but her words are lost to the wind that whips tendrils of black hair before her face, obscuring her eyes and plastering dark strands to her cheeks. Behind her hair, her features begin to twist, distort; I blink my eyes to clear my vision, but still her faceno, her entire body nowwavers as though Im seeing her through water. She comes closer, and her beautiful hands are expanding, bloating, her fingers transforming into grotesque and slimy things as she clutches my wrist. You let me go, she says, her words suddenly clear and hard. You let me
Neima! The voice turns softer, younger, and the grip on my wrist slackens as I open my eyes to find Shai peering at me through the darkness. You were dreaming, she says. You were shaking and
Did I wake the others? I whisper, casting a worried glance around the room. Its too dark to make out more than huddled shapes against the walls.
No, Shai answers softly, I was already awake. I came over here to see Aliye
We both look down at the dove in her blanket-nest. The white of her feathers gleams against the dark, and I can see the outline of her head tucked against her breast. Sleeping standing upIll never understand how birds do that.
because I couldnt sleep, Shai finishes. Is itis it true that the whole world is covered with water? That we will be trapped in here forever?
Oh, no, I say automatically, reaching my arms toward her. She falls into me, and I hold her warm body close against minebut I cant help thinking of Deryas arms reaching, of her cold, wet dream-hands.
Are weShais whisper is muffled noware we going to die?
No, I say again; I picture Deryas dream-face contorting as she accuses me of lying. Shais fingers press into my arms, as if shes asking me for something more, but Im not sure what to give her. Our grandfatherand perhaps, by this point, Shais parents as wellwould say that Noahs one God will protect us, that he has chosen us to survive. But whether those words are true or not, they dont seem very comforting to me. So instead I say, Youre with the people who love you most, and well do everything we can to keep you safe.
Shai doesnt respond, and soon I feel her body grow heavier against mine as she falls back into sleep. But I cant shut out Deryas voice telling me, You let me go. You let me Because its true: I did let her go. I could have worked harder to make her believe me, during that last fight. I could have looked for her the morning of the storm. I could have dragged her into the ark with us, just as a precaution, even though we didnt know what would happen
And another question needles at me, adding extra pinpricks of guilt: Why didnt I dream of Jorin? Yes, there was that brief glimpse of him at the sheep shearing, but I didnt see him pleading with me in those days before the storm, didnt see our parting at the ark doors, didnt see him drowning, dying
I dont even want to think it. Perhaps I didnt dream of Jorin because we left each other with kind words rather than anger. Yesthat must be it.
Im afraid to fall back into sleep, to risk another nightmare, but my exhaustion is bone deep and my eyelids grow heavier and heavier, until finally I can fight their weight no longer.
I sleep, with Shai in my lap and Aliye the dove beside me.

I wake to another dim morning, and to reliefrelief edged with guilt. For no more dreams have troubled my sleep.

***

Three more days passone, two, three slashes on the ark wall behind the spot where I sleepand we develop a routine of sorts. Since Im the youngest and strongest of the women save Shai, I spend the morning filling water buckets on deck and hauling them down to the lower level, over and over till my arms ache. My mother, Nemzar, Zeda, and even Shai stay on the lower level, where they alternate watering the animals with the full buckets I bring them, and filling empty waste buckets with animal refuse. They leave the waste by the ladder for me to carry up and toss overboard. In three days Ive perfected the art of flinging the foul-smelling stuff as far from the ark as possible, without once looking down at the churning waves and whatever horrors they might toss my way.
Japheth sometimes joins me on my trips up and down the ladder, though hes not much helphes merely searching for an excuse to check on Arisi. Unlike the rest of us, Arisi hasnt recovered from her sickness; every few hours it seems she suffers a spell of nausea so severe she cant stand, or even sit up straight. Were all worried, but Japheth most of all. Unfortunately, whenever he manages to sneak a few minutes with his wife, Noah soon notices his absence and calls him back to whatever task is keeping the men busy.
Father tells me the mens work is never-ending, for any damage to the ark from floating debris, rotting wood or even woodworms must be repaired immediately, lest we all end up beneath the waves. And theyre checking and repairing the animal cages as well, after all the jostling they took during the storm. A tiger or jackal running loose through the ark would be as disastrous as a leak, and Noah is equally concerned with the cages of rabbits and hedgehogs, moles and shrews: he reminds us that one lost creature would mean the death of all animals of that kind, and God has entrusted them all to our care. Again my mind turns to the trader and his tales of exotic creaturescreatures we certainly arent caring forbut I know better than to speak of those stories, or even to think them too loudly.
Kenaans supposed to be feeding and cleaning up after the flesh-eaters in addition to helping the men, and occasionally I see him meandering through the cages, tossing bits of meat through the bars. Whenever we cross paths, he gives me that lopsided smile Derya once found so charming, as though nothing has changed between us. That smile makes my stomach feel worse than the foul odors and the rocking of the ship combined, but I dont feel ready to confront him, so I merely cast my eyes away from him and hurry to clean another cage.
Kenaan himself certainly isnt doing much cleaning: the tigers and wolves cages are littered with droppings old and new, and I imagine I can smell an extra sharpness amid the general stench every time I near them. I feel terrible for the tigers, and perhaps if I can work up the courage, Ill clean their cage myself one day soon. Somehow, though, I cant bring myself to suffer much pity for the wolves and jackals. Their shrewd, vicious eyes remind me a bit of Munzirs, and their snarls seem to grow in proportion to the shrinking of their bellies.
I hope Kenaan is still tending to his birds and reptiles on the second level at least, for no one else is. But Im not going to ask him.
Around midday, or as close as we can gettime is fuzzy here, without the sun to guide uswe return to the second level for a short while, where we attempt to recover from the suffocating odor and closeness down below. Those of us who can manage it choke down a bit of bread, and we all gulp down rainwater, the one supply we have more than enough of. Its not as sweet as our river water, but with our parched throats, it will do. Then its back below to feed the animals. Weve decided that if we feed them later in the day, theyll be less likely to cry out with hunger in the night, disturbing our own slumber.
There are so many creatures to tend that wed waste time by working together, so we each take one of the arks vast rooms. Even Shai works on her own, caring for some of the farm animals on the left side of the ark. Ive claimed the room farthest to the right, where the elephants are penned.
It would seem impossible, what with the animal life teeming through the ark and the family I know are only a wall or two away, but somehow the space around me becomes lonesome, even desolate, on these long afternoons. The animal noises fade into a dull, eerie hum, and my body braces as if expecting an ill-intentioned intruder to ambush me at any moment. I imagine Deryas ghost rising from the waves, flowing like mist through the walls of the ark, and wrapping those cold, dripping-wet arms around me
But Im deceiving myself, for I fear I am sensing a prowler in the darkness, someone much more substantialand potentially dangerousthan a ghost:
Kenaan. Weve avoided each other since we set foot on the ark, and even before that, since that awful afternoon in the forest. Eventually something will have to give. And if he thought he had some right to me before, then now, when I might as well be the only unmarried woman in the world save his sister
Id rather think about Deryas ghost.
On the seventh afternoon, my worries finally get the best of me. Im pouring grain for the animals nearest the left wallporcupines and squirrels, hares and voleswhen I hear a plodding footstep on the other side of the wall. I freeze; the footstep stops. I move on, shaking my head, telling myself to calm down; the footsteps continue, two, three, four, almost in time with my own. My heartbeat becomes faster, lighter, mirroring the frenzied scrabble of the squirrels claws as I approach their cage.
Of course you hear footsteps, I tell myself. Its Mother or Aunt Zeda, feeding animals on the other side of the wall. I listen a moment longer, shake my head again, almost as though Im arguing with myselfthese footsteps are much too heavy to belong to a woman. So its Father or Ham. But why would they be walking along the interior wall, so slowly and deliberately, stopping when I stop and moving when I move? Youre just imagining that.
Finally I can take it no longer; if Kenaan is on the other side of that wall, Id rather confront him head-on. Or so I tell myself, though the pulse threatening to fly out my throat seems to say otherwise. I lower my sack of grain to the floor and creep along the wall, toward the doorway, hoping I can peek around the corner and discover the prowler before he knows Im coming. I'm almost therethree steps, two steps, oneand I hold my breath, bite hard on my lip to stop any sound from escaping as I poke my head through the doorway
to find myself a hands breadth from the fleshy, smelly open mouth of a camel. My heart gives one heavy thud in my chest, a combination of shock and relief, before it begins to slow again. What are you doing all the way over here? I ask the beast. Weve tied the camels on the left side of the ark, near the farm animals. I inspect the goat-hair rope hanging from this ones neck to find that heor shehas chewed through it. Surely someone should have seen you wandering through and taken you back? Im talking toher, Ill settle on heras though she can understand me, more for my sake than hers, trying to convince myself everythings normal. Or as normal as it can be, under the circumstances.
I grab the end of the rope lead, inspecting the tooth-gnawed edges. Looks like it took some work to chew all the way through, so if I tie her up again, maybe shell stay put for at least a day.
When I tug on the rope and step forward across the ark, the camel follows docilely enough. What did you want over here, then? I ask her, expecting Mother or Aunt Zeda to dart out at any moment and grumble about my talking to the air. But I make it all the way to the other end of the ark without a single interruption. They must all be upstairs already, then, and it must be later than I thought. Still, I feel a bit safer now that my menacing intruder revealed herself as a placid camel, and after Ive tied her back to her post, I decide to bring some extra hay back to the elephants.
The elephants have already eaten all the hay that once lined the floor within their fence, and when I dump this new bale down and begin pulling it apart to make bedding, Enise and Bilal immediately grab trunkfuls and stuff them into their wide mouths. I wish they wouldnt; I dont think the wood floor is good for them. Im afraid some type of sore, or fungus, is creeping up from the soles of their feet, between the cracks of their oddly charming toenails; but I dont want to look too close, since I have no way to help them.
Bilal butts my side with his trunk, offering me some hay. Youre sweet, I tell him, but I dont think my stomach can handle I break off as I realize hes holding not hay, but the block of wood I found the other day. Not this again? I take the wood from his trunk, turn it over in my hands. I dont have the time or energy to My words peter out once more as I examine the wood more closely. Surely the remnant I found the other day wasnt quite so large, and it didnt have that beautiful reddish-gold whorl near one edge, which would make the perfect elephant eye. I could carve the trunk right there, where the side slopes down, and then the floppy ear But I dont even have time to think of all this. And more importantly
Where would Bilal get a second piece of wood?

***

Ive put the mystery out of my mind by the time I climb the ladder to the second floor. Arisi is alone in the womens room, and she answers the question in my eyes before I can voice it: The others are up in the deck house.
Even Shai?
Arisi shrugs. Zeda said the air would be good for her. She tried to get me to come too. I slump to the floor beside Arisi as she continues, I dont think theyre letting Shai out on deck, though.
I close my eyes and attempt to shut out the vision of that great mass of water teeming below the deck, dark and unfathomable as an endless nightmare. An unsettling scuttling sound forces my eyes open again; Im relieved to find its just Aliye, shuffling her way toward me, looking very put out that her wings still refuse to lift her. She bobs her head forward and back as she moves, letting out an occasional squawk, like an old woman clucking and scolding her grandchildren. Maybe shes not only bothered by her wingI think shes annoyed with me for sitting by Arisi rather than in my usual spot beside her nest.
Theyre cooking lentils, Arisi says. And an egg, with such wonder in her voice youd think eggs were made of gold. Now that were not quite so seasick, Noah has brought out the hearthstones and cooking pots he asked Grandmother Nemzar to carry on board, and the deck house has become our makeshift kitchen. We still dont have enough foodwere rationing carefully, since we have no idea how long our supplies must last usbut at least we have a slightly greater variety now. We even have a bit of milk from our goat and cow.
I think Aliyes hungry too, I say as the dove reaches me and begins to peck around my hands, where Im sure she smells the grain Ive been handling all day. Arisi produces a hunk of rock-hard bread from what appears to be her personal stash, and I do my best to break it into pieces for the bird. Only then do I register what Arisis been doing: she has a long coil of goat-hair rope on her lap and is separating it into thinner strands. Judging by the number of separate pieces on her lap, shes been at it for a while. A flash comes to me of the camel down below, gnawing at her rope, and I cant help but shiver.
Arisi notices my staring and holds up a few of the strands. Im going to knot them together into a fishing net. She breaks into a sheepish but sunny grin. Or at least Ill try to.
Relief rolls through me, warm and soothing. It will be good for Arisi to have a task, and, as I tell her aloud, We could certainly use the fish, if theres any left out there. Its hard to believe any living creatures could have survived this destruction, but then fish would find the water a refuge rather than a death trap.
Noah didnt ask us to bring live fish on board, Arisi points out, as though she can read my thoughts. Sometimes I suspect she really can.
How would we even I imagine Kenaan trying to capture all manner of fish in a bucket or barrel, claiming hes found one male and one female of each type, and then scrambling to separate them by kind before the larger ones eat the smaller. Perhaps Im just too exhausted and overwrought, but somehow the idea seems so ridiculous, I cant stop myself from laughing out loud.
And once I start laughing, I cant seem to stop.
My giggles must be contagious, for Arisi soon joins in, letting out great, desperate heaves of laughter that I worry will exhaust her. I assume shes picturing a scene similar to the one in my own head. Even Aliye, unwilling to be left out, gives a few chuckle-like chirrups.
You know what Im really hungry for? Arisi gasps out between laughs. She regains control of herself, holding her breath for a long, dramatic moment before she lets out Dirt.
Dirt? I laugh even harder.
Yes, dirt, she says, in the same awestruck voice as egg. Just think of it: that rich, earthy, meaty scent
mmm, yes Id give anything to smell solid ground right now.
the rough, grainy feel of it between your hands Arisi rubs her fingers together almost greedily.
Oh, yes, I say.
the crunch and the weight of it in your mouth, against your tongue
She lost me there.
And you know what else? she goes on, the pitch of her voice rising higher and higher. Salt. Oh, I could eat an entire barrel full of salt. Those beautiful, glorious, shining white crystalsIm dizzy with wanting it.
My stomach sinks, the last of my laughter dying away all at once, as I realize Arisis not joking. She really does want to eat dirtand salt. We could have brought salt onto the ark, if wed only known, only thought ahead, and then perhaps Arisi wouldnt be so sick and miserable now.
If wed only known, if wed only thought ahead So many things might be different. Derya and Jorin might be sitting here beside me, instead of Instead of
I close my eyes again, desperate to push back the weight of everything I cant change. Arisi continues to rhapsodize about saltsalt on bread, salt on goat cheese, salt by the handfuluntil her words become a tuneless lullaby, a nonsense song for children. I focus on the subtle shifting of the ark beneath me, a motion Im so used to I barely notice it anymore, and I tell myself its no more than the gentle rocking of a babys cradle.

***

After my encounter with the camel, I thought Id be able to relax a bit, but by the afternoon of the eighth day Im on edge again. I just cant shake the sense that some creature is following mea creature with two legs, not fourand I swear I feel eyes boring through me. Sentient, self-aware eyes that see me as more than a source of grain or dried meat. I search the space around me as I move through the room, but the ark is so dim, so full of shadowy corners and narrow spaces between cages, so alive with bursts of animal movement, that my efforts seem pointless.
To add to my unease, I keep finding wood remnants near the cages, remnants I would swear werent there the day before. I suppose the workers left many scraps behind while building the arkafter all, they never believed anyone would use itand that these scraps would shift with the movement of the water beneath us. Still, there are so many, and they seem so deliberately placed in my path, that I find it hard to believe its all coincidence. Theres one next to the flower birdswhose feathers are no longer the color of my favorite flowers, but have faded to a dull, tired whiteone inside the baby lions cage, and another piece by the shrews thats so large I trip over it and nearly
Wait. What was that? There it is again: a flicker of movement, a blur of what looks like cloth. As soon as I turn toward the motion, it stopswhich only makes me more suspicious. The familiar signs of panic rise upmy breath quickens, my heart flutters like flapping wingsand I quickly force them down. I will not let Kenaan get the best of me.
I take a step forward, in the direction of the movement, and I see yet another flicker, this one farther to the right. I turn to follow, my steps surer now, for I have the advantage here, where he cant go much farther before ramming into the ark wall. And my knife is still tucked safely in the belt Ive refused to take off, though the cloth is now more gray-brown than blue. Come to think of it, the transformation of my clothing reminds me of the bit of flower-birds feathers.
Im distracting myselfyes, thats good. Already my heartbeat has returned to a steady, determined boom in my chest. I take another step forward, then another; the elephants see me and trumpet, but Im tracking the movement away from their corner, into that dark mass of cages
You might as well come out, Kenaan, I call. My voice sounds surer than I feel, and it gives me new courage. I know youre there, I go on. We need to talk. Were going to be on this ark together for a while, and
A figure steps slowly forward from between two cages, still in shadow so all I can see is a hint of his ripped, once-white tunic and, above ita flash of gold? It must be a trick of the light. I take a deep breath, step forward again just as the figure moves closer, and
Gold. Golden bronze hair above a face grown thinner, lined with streaks of dirt but still unbearably familiar and it cant be, hes dead but
I take in the torn clothing, the leaner frame that seems to waver, not quite substantial, the silent footfalls, and I know:
Its Jorins ghost. Im not sure if hes real, or just a vision conjured up by my own guilt and longing, but either way the urge to scream rises from my gut, all the way to my throat, choking me
he comes closer, closer, till I can hold my cries of alarm back no longer, and then
Shh, shh, the spirit speaks, placing two heavy hands on my arms
how could a ghosts hands hold such warmth and weight?
Neima. Its me, Jorin. That voice Those hands
I run my own hands over his arms, his chest, cup his cheeks between my palms, trying to convince myself hes truly here, flesh and blood. Is it really you? I say aloud. My hands make their way back down his body, searching for a heartbeat.
Neima, Ive never known you to be so forward. Ill have to suffer through near-death by drowning more often. His face, though dirty and ravaged, breaks into that familiar impish grin.
And then I know its really him, and, improper though it may be, I throw my arms around him. How did you I speak into his shoulder.
I followed you into the ark, he says as I pull back to examine him again, still overcome with the miracle of it. I had to talk to you, and you just wouldnt listen. His words tumble out, fast and jumbled, as though now hes begun speaking he cant stop. And then Noah closed the doors, and the rain was so strong, and I couldnt get out And then the floor started to rise
Neima! A sharp female voice rings through the ark. My mother. Instantly Jorin disappears into the shadows as she calls, Are you all right? I thought I heard you cry out.
I turn toward Mother where she hovers in the doorway. Fine, I call back. I only tripped and startled myself.
Though I cant see her clearly, I know her eyes are narrowed, lips pursed as she regards me. Well, hurry and finish up, she says at last. I dont want you down here by yourself. And then she turns and walks away.
I cant force myself to wait more than a breath before I run back to Jorin. Why havent you revealed yourself? I ask. We could use another set of hands, and you must be absolutely miserable, stuck down here with the stench and the stale air
Jorin grabs my wrist, hard. Neima, you cant tell them.
Why not?
Ive overheard your grandfatherhe believes your family is special, set apart, that only you were meant to survive this disaster. What will he do if he thinks Ive destroyed his plan?
I consider that for a moment. Noahs not a monster. Perhaps hell think his God has placed you here
The grip on my wrist tightens. Neima, no. You must promise to tell no one.
I study his facethe set of his jaws, the lowered brows, the darkened eyesand the certainty I see there frightens me.
Allall right, I say, sure theres something Im not understanding, perhaps something he hasnt told me. But then my thoughts turn in another direction. Youyouve been following me for days. You left those wood remnants for me!
He casts his gaze downward, sheepish yet satisfied. I can see it in your eyes, Neima, when you look at those animalsyou want to capture them in the wood. You should do it. You should let yourself do something just for the pleasure of it. You need itwe all do.
I dont know what to say to that, so I settle on a more practical question: How do you even know I have my knife?
He smiles again, but its softer, more subdued. Because I know you, Neima. Something seems different about him, something beyond his physical transformation. A new sadness hides behind his words, beneath the curve of his lipsa sorrow Ive never seen before, not even when he spoke of his father. This disaster has changed him, as its changed us all. He reaches for me, tentative now, and brushes his fingers across my shoulder
and I pull away, suddenly irritated. You followed me. Watched me without my permission. Frightened me.
Im sorry, I just
Its Its I search for the right word. Its wrong. Its an intrusion.
I know. I said Im sorry, all right? I think I wanted you to find me, if that makes you feel better. I scowl at him, and he throws his hands up in frustration. I just had to make sure you were safe, in case Kenaan tried anything. After I failed you last time
My breath catches. With the surprise and relief of finding Jorin alive, I completely forgot why I was so angry with him. Now, he takes advantage of my confusion and grabs my hand.
Listen, Neima: thats what I wanted to tell you. When I saw you and Kenaan, II thought maybe you wanted him to So I hung back, and by the time I was sure, you were already fighting him off, and I tried to come help you, but you were so fast
I look away. Its all right. It hardly seems to matter anymore, with all thats happened. I force myself to stare into those brown eyes, not so open and hopeful as they used to be, but still flecked with hints of gold. I dont suppose Deryas hiding here as well?
Now he looks away. No. No, Im afraid not.
A moment stretches out in what seems like silence, despite the animal jabbering that fills the room; then a wolfs howl rents the air, high and keening and mournful. I shiver and say, Look, Jorin, Ive promised not to reveal your presence; will you promise me something as well?
His hand squeezes mine. Of course.
Dont follow me anymore. Its eerie enough down here without
Butbut Kenaan! If he tries anything, Ill never forgive myself.
I drop his hand and reach for my belt, pulling up the handle of my knife tucked within until Jorin can see it. I can take care of myself. I did before.
All right, he agrees, but his hands clench into fists at his sides. He opens his mouth to say more, and then
Neima! Mother again, though the echo of her voice tells me shes still a safe distance from us. Were all going upstairs. Hurry and finish up.
Yes, Mother, I call back as frustration fills me. Why must she choose this day to be concerned? I wait a few breaths before whispering to Jorin, I should go, or theyll get suspicious. But Ill come back tonight, when theyre sleeping. Ill see if I can find you a fresh tunicAunt Zeda brought extrasand a blanket, some bread and water How have you survived for so long?
Jorin casts his eyes downward, rolls his shoulders inward: sheepish again. Ive been poaching off the animals. But just a little from each one, I swear!
Not the tigers, I hope?
He grins, relaxes his shoulders. No, not the tigers. Nor the wolves or jackals.
All right, well I can hardly bear to leave him. Im afraid hell vanish again, that all this is no more than a desperate wish, a vision brought to life by my own hunger and confusion. But I have to go. Tonight. Ill meet you by the elephants? Impulsively I grab his arm once more, squeezing the solid flesh.
Ow! He shakes his arm in pretended agony. You dont have to maul me! Ill be here, though I have to say, it will be quite an imposition on my valuable time.
I smile again; it feels good. Tonight, I whisper, and then I turn to go.

***

I intend to doze awhile before I bring Jorin the supplies Ive gathered and hidden under my blanket: a full water skin, a sack of bread and raisins, and a tunic of Kenaans Ive taken from Zedas stash. If she notices it missing, she shouldnt have any reason to suspect me.
Still, once night falls and even Aliye and the other birds next door quiet down, I find my body and mind unwilling to fall into sleep. Maybe its a good thing, since I wont suffer through another nightmare of Deryas ghost Then something occurs to me. Thats why I didnt dream of Jorins ghost. Some part of me must have sensed his presence here, alive and only steps away from me in the depths of the ark.
When I can hear not only the snoring of the women beside me, but the even louder breaths and snorts and wheezes drifting in from the mens room next door, I know its time.
I hold my breath as I gather my hidden stash, rise to my feet, and tiptoe toward the doorway. My greatest fear is that Aliye will wake and call out, but to my relief, she doesnt. Then I have to weave a perilous path through the sleeping men, within a darkness so deep it seems solid, in order to reach the ladder. Halfway down the rungs, my foot lands too hard, and the wood groans below me. I freeze, certain Im about to be discovered, but when the snoring continues I creep the rest of the way down to the lower level.
I know the blackness hides wild things with sharp teethI can hear some of them crying out and others pacing, prowling in their cagesbut Im too excited to feel much fear. Still, I wish Id thought to bring one of Aunt Zedas oil lamps. Though I hold my arms out before me, I knock against cages quite a few times, but eventually I make it to the far wall. Im feeling down the length of it for the doorway when a hand falls onto my shoulder, and my whole body seems to snap in shock.
Ive just recovered enough to breathe again, and Ive opened my mouth to tell Jorin off for scaring me, when a pair of lips presses against mine. Fleshy, demanding, somehow familiar lips, and I know
Its Kenaan.
I drop my sack to the ground, use both arms to push him away with all my strength. He goes willingly enough, only to snarl out, Still playing coy, Neima? Surely you know theres no point to that any longer. He moves closer again, so I can smell the sweaty, animal stink of him, and kicks the sack at my feet. The sloshing sound of water reverberates in my gut as he asks, Water for your precious elephants, huh? They cant wait for morning like the rest of these miserable creatures?
A pause; I can sense his body coiling with tension, a predator about to strike. Or was there another reason you snuck down here?
I freeze, willing myself not to panic, not to reveal how close hes come to the truth.
You know what I think? He moves closer still, so I can feel the hot puffs of his breath hitting my face, can see the gleam of his teeth against the darkness. My back is pressed against the ark wall now; I have no space left to retreat. I think you wanted me to hear you, to wake and follow you down here. I think you want this as much as I do
I actually relax the smallest bit; Kenaans inflated ego has him so thoroughly deluded, I wont have to worry about him discovering the truth. But then he breaks through the meager space left between us, closes his lips over mine once more
and I realize I still have plenty to worry about. I cant breathe, cant escape the acrid taste of him and the insistent pressure of his body against mine. Though I cant see them in the darkness, a vision of his eyes swims before me: black and narrowed, shrewd and cold. Hungry. Jackals eyes. Wolfs eyes. Then his hands are on me, pawing at my threadbare shift, but they dont touch my belt and I realize the darkness gives me an advantage as well. Kenaan is so sure of himself, hes not even bothering to restrain my arms.
I take a deep breath. Steel myself.
And then, all in one movement, I pull the knife from my belt and place the cold, sharp edge against his throat.
His mouth goes slack against mine. His hands fall from my shift. He steps back, and I let him, but I continue to hold the knife up before him.
Have you gone mad, Neima? he asks, his voice shifting from bluster to disbelief. Where did you even get
I have not gone mad, I cut him off, fighting to keep my own voice from trembling. But we are not married yetI step toward him, and he stumbles back, away from the knifeand I will not allow you to touch me. We move in an awkward sort of dance, keeping a safe distance between us, dodging cages as we make our way back to the ladder. Im afraid my heart will beat itself out of my chest, but I manage to keep my steps sure, my breath steady, till Kenaan reaches the ladder and scrambles up it.
I wait to see if hell return with the others, though I dont think he willhe has too much pride to reveal what happened tonight. By the time my heartbeat has slowed, Im sure hes not coming back.
I tuck my knife into my belt and take a few steps away from the ladder and into the darkness. I know that once again, Im not alone, and theres no point in trekking all the way to the elephants.
I take a deep breath. All right, I say. You can come out.

Chapter Nine

By the time Jorin and I reach the elephants, my limbs have stopped trembling, but my muscles seem about to melt with the sudden release of tension. Jorin clearly knows this maze of cages better than I do, and hes led me through the darkness without a single misstep or collision; still, Im so exhausted that, after fumbling through the latched door of the elephants fence, I nearly collapse onto the filthy floor. I feel around for Bilal and Enises familiar leathery skin, and I find the nearest of the two lying on its side, legs and trunk outstretched. My hand catches on the cold smoothness of its little tusksso this is Bilal, not Enise. Ive never seen the elephants sleeping before, and somehow I imagined theyd do so standing up, like Aliye upstairs; but I like the fact that they sleep lying down. It makes them seem more childlike, somehow. More human.
I lean my back against Bilals broad stomach as it moves in and out in the slow, peaceful rhythm of sleep. Jorin lowers himself to the ground beside me, and Im sure the elephant will sense our combined weight and wake, but he doesnt. I curl my knees to my chest, resting my head upon them, and listen to Jorin rifling through the sack. He finds the water quickly, and the sound of him gulping it down lasts far too long. Some of that was for washing, I grumble. I remember his grime-streaked face, and I know he must stink, though the stench of the animals drowns out everything else. I stink, toowe all dobut at least the rest of us have the rain to wash off the worst of the sweat and dirt.
Sorry, he gasps out between more hurried sips, justsothirsty
Ill bring you more tomorrow, when Im tending to the animals. My voice comes out sharper, snippier than I intended.
A few last sips and then I hear the sound of the empty water skin hitting the floor, the collapse and the soft escape of air. I kept my promise, didnt I? Jorin says. I didnt follow youor, well, I didnt come too close. I let you handle Kenaan.
Yesyes, you did. Still, all the excitement of this night, the thrill of seeing Jorin and sharing his secret, has scattered and dissolved into the murky air around us. Ruinednot by Jorin, but by Kenaan. I know Jorin feels it too; I can tell by the way he distracts himself, sifting through the rest of the pack and examining the contents by touch and smell. Most of the animals are quiet, and I almost wish for the grumbles of wildcats and the howls of wolves, or at least the dull thud of the rain on the roof thats become such a constant upstairs.
Rain. Jorin cant hear the rain down here, and Im sure he cant imagine the extent of the disaster outside. No wonder he refuses to reveal himselfhe probably thinks that in just a few more days, the waters rocking the floor beneath us will recede, and well all leave this wretched prison.
Its still raining, you know, I say. The water has risen higher than you can imagine, and it seems to be holding steady, if not rising further. Even Noah hasnt told us when we might expectwhen this will end. Ive wondered if my grandfather has some idea, but Ive been afraid to ask, to hear confirmed what I already suspect: that Noah has no more real knowledge or understanding of this disaster than the rest of us. Someone else will find you eventually, or youll be forced out when I cant bring you enough food. I dont see why you cant just
Jorins hand, warm and soft and miraculously dry in this dank place, closes over my arm. No. You dont understand
So tell me.
I hear him breathe in, out in hesitation, and then: I heard them. I heard the people banging on the side of the ark, shouting, begging to be let in.
Youwhat? His words are strange, indecipherable. Nonsensical.
He puts his other hand on top of mine, squeezes tight. I imagine his eyes piercing straight into me, the gold in them flashing, though I see only darkness. I found this nook between the ark walls, right where the two sides join together. Its actuallyits just behind us, there. He takes one hand from my arm to point, a wasted gesture in the blackness. Your father and the others only come by about once a day, and they make so much noise that I have plenty of warning first. Those first few days, when I could still hear the rain driven sideways against the walls, and then when the floor started to shift, I just lay there with my head against the wall and II could hear them. Not all the words, but the screaming
I remember those first few days I sat with my own head leaning against the side of the ark, one floor above this one. I didnt hear any screams. It cant be
You were probably confused, I say. We all werewe were dazed and sick and frightened. The wind can sound like voices, and it would have flung trees and fences and bits of houses against the ark
No, Neima. I thought I might be imagining it at first; I wished I was imagining it. But then I overheard
He stops, lifts his remaining hand from mine. What? I ask, needing to know now. You overheard what?
Jorin lets out a long, heavy breath before responding, Isnt that enough? They were begging to be let in, and your grandfather wouldnt allow it.
I shake my head, though I know he cant see it. Even if people were outside the arkand I still think you imagined itwe couldnt hear them up on the second level. We didnt know.
They knew, Neima. Your grandfather and the other menthey heard. They saw, when they were up on deck.
No But as I penetrate the haze of those first few days, it comes back to me, muted, as though seen through a fog: Noah climbing up and down the ladder, his hands trembling on the rungs. Ham and my father and Japheth, following after him.
They came down here to argue about it, Neima, and thats what I overheard. Jorin flings the words out now, each one like a little stone. Noah said his God intended for those people to perish, that they were not righteous. Ham seemed to agree. Japheth wanted to rescue whoever they could, but
He stops. I still think he might have imagined all thisI remember my own confusion, my own nightmares, and I had water and air and company where Jorin had only darkness and the smells and cries of beasts. Despite my thoughts, though, his stone-words seem to have settled in my stomach, weighing me down. But what? What about my father?
A pause, another heavy breath, and then Hehe didnt say much. He seemed to agree with Noah.
Im on my feet before Ive fully comprehended his words. Youre lying. Im shaking my head, wringing my hands, but I know to Jorin Im just a disembodied voice. My father would never allow innocent people to die, not if he could do something to help.
Jorin pushes himself up too, moving toward me, though Im already backing away. I didnt want to tell you, Neima he starts, but I break in.
Youre lying. Theres some other reason you dont want to reveal yourself, so you invented
No.
His voice is rising, and mine does too as I continue, fumbling for the latch in the fence. Youre lying, or youre confused, or Youre just wrong.
I
A sudden series of sounds drown out Jorins words: a creaking of the wooden beams beneath us, a shuffling and shifting of some massive weight, and finally a bellow of distress. See what youve done now? I snap at him. Youve disturbed the elephants! Both of them are crying out nowEnises cries are shorter and higher than Bilals bellow, and even more trying to my ears.
I expect Jorin to offer some flippant reply, but to his credit, he doesnt. I finally find the latch, and Im half in, half out of the pen when a trunk wraps around my wrist. Not now, I say, shaking it off. Even the elephants are a nuisance tonight.
Neima
Good night, Jorin. I sigh. Ill leave your water here tomorrow.

***

I wake, groggier than usual, to the familiar sound of Noah railing at Japheth. Its always something differentJapheth is too slow to start work, or too quick to finish; he feeds the animals too much or too little; he carelessly drops a bucket of water or fails to notice a hole in a sack of feed. Its always something different, but its always something. I suppose my grandfather and his youngest son have always bickered like this; I was simply never forced to witness it so often before.
Japheths response is always the same, too: first he pretends he doesnt hear Noah, which only makes his grandfather louder and more vehement; then, inevitably, Japheth will mumble something that sends Noah into a complete fury. Father will loom over son, jabbing a shaking finger at Japheths forehead, or even near one eye, and then
Only this last part varies. Usually Japheth ends up stalking away, head lowered, shoulders slumped, hands fisted as though hes holding all his anger within himself. But sometimeslike now, for instance, as I sit up to find Im the last one to awaken, that the rest of the men are trickling into the womens room, in search of a few bites of breadGrandmother Nemzar intervenes.
I watch her step behind Noah, place her hands on his shoulders, and whisper something in his earsomething soft and soothing, judging by the way his expression slackens and his complaints fade to mutters. Japheth takes the opportunity to slink away, back to Arisi, who offers a smile so convincing, even I almost believe shes oblivious to the tension around her. How does she do it? How does she stay so patient and considerate of others when shes sick and starving for salt and meat and even dirt?
I turn my attention back to my grandmother, who is subtly leading Noah away from Japheth and Arisi, and similar questions flood my mind. Doesnt Nemzar get tired of taking care of everyone else, of snuffing their anger out like flames between her bare fingers? Doesnt she have any anger of her own? Doesnt she ever want to just scream at everyone to stop, to take care of their own problems, to leave her alone? Or does she worry that if she started screaming, she wouldnt be able to stop?
Or maybe thats just me.
Mother walks by then, scowling. Why arent you up, Neima? she demands. We have work to do.
What does it matter anyway? Were all going to die here, so why break our backs lugging food and water to animals who are dying already? Noits not so easy to say what you think.
I push myself to my feet, grab an empty water skin and head for the ladder, though first I scan the room for Kenaan. Hes in the corner with his parents, eating and scratching himself. An involuntary ripple of disgust rolls through me before I turn my eyes elsewhere, relieved; I want to go on deck, where I can breathe, but not if Kenaans up there. Before I can escape, though, my gaze snags on another face I dont want to see. To tell the truth, right now this one troubles me even more than Kenaans.
My father. Hes rooting through a bag of supplies, not looking anywhere near me, and I cant help but study him for a moment. His hair and beard have grown too long, wild and disheveled, and his eyes have a strange gleam to them, a determination that hovers just at the edge of despair. Its how I imagine my own eyes must look, now, and
Father wouldnt leave innocent people to die, or even guilty ones. It isnt possible.
I shake my head to clear the murk inside, and then I head up the ladder, toward the familiar rainfall.

***

Later that morning, I manage to leave some water for Jorin, as promised; and he stays away, hidden somewhere in the shadows, as promised. I no longer feel eyes on me throughout the endless gray afternoon; I no longer stumble over oddly shaped pieces of wood in my path. And strangely enough, I somehow feel a little disappointed, even lonely. Well, theres no reason to, and Ill just have to put it out of my mind.
And then, when the animals have all been given their paltry portion of food, and the cages are as clean as theyll get for the day, which isnt very, I make one last trip to the deck so I can rinse some of the muck off in the rain. And I find my father, standing alone, gazing out at the gray-green waves.
This is it. This is my chance to prove Jorin wrong, to settle my worries once and for all. I move toward Father, my steps muffled by the rain, and Im sure he wont hear me coming. Ill be able to back out, if I decide to, right up until the moment I put a hand on his arm and ask
He whirls toward me, eyes narrowed, when Im still several arms length from him. He looks so on guard, as if he fears being caught at something, that it makes my throat constrict. Then he seems to realize its only me; his eyes soften, his mouth lifting in a tentative smile. You startled me, he says. Has his voice always sounded so thick and parched, so weary? Or is it just warped by the unceasing echo of the rain?
I I have to get this over with. I have something to ask you, Father, if I may.
His eyes narrow again, this time in confusion, or perhaps concern. Yes?
Did you Were there I take a breath and then let it all out, as quick as I can. Is it true people were begging to be let on the ark, and you refused them?
His eyes widen for a moment, his body slumps in a way I instantly recognize as guilt, and then he casts his gaze back down on the water. He doesnt have to say anything; I already know.
His voice rasps like two sticks rubbed together as he begins, How did you The question falls away unfinished, barely distinguishable from the rainfall.
Ive already planned for this, so I say, I overheard Ham telling Kenaan. It seems like something my uncle would do. I open my mouth again, ready to ask Father how he could possibly allow this, but the words refuse to come out. I am not supposed to question my father, just as he is not supposed to question his father. But the entire world is not supposed to fill with water, either, and our village isnt supposed to be destroyed and my best friend isnt supposed to
What does supposed to matter anymore?
So I ask, Why?, and my voice comes out higher, more of a whine than I would like, as though Im just a child who cant possibly understand the ways of men.
I half expect Father to scream at me, even to slap me, though hes never done so before. But then Ive never questioned him like this before. For a moment, everything feels so silent that Id swear even the rain has stopped, that the whole world is holding its breath.
When Father finally speaks, his voice is calmer, more resigned than I expected. We had no choice, Neima. These were the same people threatening to burn the ark down just days earlier. What do you think would have happened if wed let them all on board?
Theythey wouldnt really have burned down But they might have. Munzir might have, and now his son is on the ark, and Im the only one who knows.
But thats not whats important here, and my next words come out before Ive thought them through. So you let them die? That makes you as bad as they are! I clamp my hand over my mouth, too late. Now Ive really gone too far.
Father takes my hand in his rough one and lowers it back to my side, his grip firm but gentle, without anger. You didnt see them, Neima. They were crowding, pushing, crushing each other like He closes his eyes. Like animals. I wish we could have let the children onthats what Japheth wanted to dobut if we had lowered a rope even for a moment, we would have been swarmed. It would have been chaos. People fighting over food, space, each othertheyd likely have destroyed the ark, or buried it under their weightthey might have slaughtered the animals below
My stomach heaves as though, once again, the ark is tilting beneath me for the first time. I picture peoplepeople Ive lived beside my entire lifemassing together like cattle, hovering like a flock of birds, or bats, panicked and thoughtless. Perhaps we humans really are beasts, monsters, even; perhaps we really should be destroyed.
Then I turn and look into my fathers eyes, and what I find theretwo dark, heavy pools of regretis somehow worse than any horrific image my mind can conjure. I understand, I say, and add silently, though I wish I didnt, before I retreat to the ladder and descend once more.

***

Before Ive even stepped off the ladder, the sound of Shai cryingwailing, reallyfloods my ears. Once my feet land on the rough wood floor, and four walls and a ceiling enclose me once more, I shut my eyes, clench my fists; Im not sure I can take this right now. But I cant ignore the feeling of Shai tug-tug-tugging at my skirt, my arm, so I open my eyes to find shes pulling me toward Aliye in her makeshift nest. When we reach the bird, Shai holds back a gasp long enough for me to hear that Aliye is crying and moaning, too, nearly as loud as Shai herself. Shes sick, Shai says, and Momma says we have to put her back in her cage, because if that bird screams near her ear one more time, she just might wring its scrawny little
She keeps going, but I block out her words as I suck in a deep breath. I look around for Shais dear Momma; shes still occupied with her husband and son, deliberately ignoring the rest of us. I wonder where Grandfather Noah is right now, and how he would feel about his daughter-in-law murdering one of his precious animals. Aliye might be one of the last two doves left in the world, after all.
I could find Noah, tell him Except I cant imagine looking into his facethose hard, dark eyes, that leathered skin framed by the white hair and beard grown longer and more tangled than everand speaking so many words. I dont speak to Grandfather, and he doesnt listen to me. Thats the way its always been.
I kneel to examine Aliye, and let out a cluck of worry. Shai is rightthe bird is thinner, noticeably so, her neck so scrawny Im afraid it will snap as she bobs it back and forth. This doesnt make sense: we spoil Aliye with bits of our bread and dried fruit, and while the rest of the animals are suffering, she should be plump. Her feathers should be thick and gleaming, not ragged and dull and so suspiciously sparse, I suspect many of them have fallen off and disappeared in the depths of her blanket-nest. Perhaps she does need to go back in her cage, I muse. Perhaps she pines for her mate. It seems too romantic an idea to be true, though.
No! Shai squeals, loud enough to startle me back onto my feet, Aliye in my cupped hands. Her protest has caught her mothers attention as well, and Zeda turns our way with a scowl so fierce I can feel it from across the room. She starts toward us, but Kenaan reaches a hand out, pulls her back, whispers something low and urgent. And then hes the one heading in our direction.
Wonderful. Just wonderful.
I avoid his eyes as he studies the bird, places a dark, dirt-streaked hand above her wing feathers. Have you been feeding it gravel?
Gravel? The word is out before I remember Im not speaking to Kenaan. Shai repeats my question, and to my relief, Kenaan responds to her rather than me, kneeling down to meet her gaze.
You have eyeshe rests two fingers on her forehead, one above each delicate eyebrowtwo perfectly capable, perfectly beautiful eyes
Shai giggles, and I try not to blame her for it. Shes only ten, and Kenaan is charming. Insufferably so. Still, I wish he would get to the point.
By the time he starts talking about chickens, Im ready to walk away, dove and all, until I hear, and youve never noticed the hens pecking at pebbles behind our house? The rock pigeons nibbling at sand and silt by the river?
I realize that I have observed this; Ive just never had reason to think about it before. I dont respond, though, and Shai only shrugs, wide-eyed. Kenaan pinches his sisters full lower lip between his thumb and forefinger, pulls it down to expose her small teeth, tweaks it a bit before releasing it and giving her nose a poke for good measure. I want to be disgusted, but theres no malice or lust in his movements; he truly loves Shai, the way an older brother should love his sister. He would never hurt herI can tell by the light in his eyes when they meet hers.
Birds dont have beautiful teeth like yours, he goes on. In fact, they dont have any teeth at all. They swallow gravel so it can grind their food to tiny pieces in their stomachs. If they cant find gravel, they get sick and weak, like your dove here. He taps three fingers gently, almost affectionately atop the birds head as he rises to his feet again.
Im stunned. How could Kenaan notice something like this, something so subtle and beautiful about the way the animal world worksworked, before it was all destroyedwhen Ive never even considered it? Wasnt he too busy chasing after pretty girls like Derya, or admiring his reflection in the river?
So why arent the other birds starving? Why is the hen below still laying eggs? Once again my questions rush out, harsh and suspicious, before I can bite them down.
Aliye squawks peevishly in my hands as if in echo, and Kenaan answers nonchalantly, Because Ive been giving them gravel. I brought a big sack of it onto the ark. He smiles down at Shai. Ill get some for your dove, and she should perk right up. He lifts his eyes to mine for a moment, still smiling but tentatively now, before he turns
turns and leaves me utterly perplexed, more furious than ever. What right does he have to be kind and thoughtful now, when I need to hold on to my hatred of him? I cant bear all thisliving with Kenaan and his parents and our grandparents, the ark, the animals, the rain, the hunger, all of itwithout the help of that hot, hard anger.
I look down at Aliye as she rests quietly in my hands, calm and placid and even sweet. Is this the same bird who was shrieking my head to pieces minutes ago? And is this Kenaan, the one whos returning now with a handful of sand and pebbles, smiling at his sister, the same boy who trapped me in the dark, pushed me against a wall and forced his lips to mine?
And while Im asking impossible questions How is my father, the man who held me close when I was Shais age, who promised hed always keep me safe, the same person who let innocent children die? And how is Grandfather Noah, my mad, foolish grandfather Noah, our prophet and savior? Is he our savior?
I hand the dove over to Shai, walk away, let her and Kenaan take care of Aliye for now. My mind, even my body is too full of wanting to hold anything else. Wanting things to be simple, clear, the way they used to be, when I knew who was good and who was bad, whom to hate and whom to love.
Wanting the world to be whole once again.


Chapter Ten

Later that evening, while everyones preoccupied with dinner and various minor crises, I gather another sack of supplies for Jorin. A peace offering. I mean to take it to him that night, but though I try to sit up till the snores all around me echo against the rainfall, I cant keep my eyes open. Soon I find myself tumbling deeper and deeper into dark, drowning dreams of Derya. I face her, both of us floating underwater; her hair twists and coils and knots like tangles of river weeds, hiding her face, arms, chest behind its shadowy mass. Black locks thread through my fingers, tickle my wrists, wrap around my arms and up to my neckDeryas hair was never this long or this strong, this alive, like a nest of snakespulling tighter, tighter till Im gasping for breath, trying to propel myself back to the surface, to wakefulness.
By the time I force my eyes open, the dim light that passes for morning has crept its way into the corners of the ark, and my mother and aunts are already stirring. So I go about my day as usual, wait for a quiet moment to smuggle the supplies down to Jorin, and leave them by the elephants pen. Hell understand what I mean by offering them, and hell know to expect me tonight.
The rest of the day passes without incident. Arisi has nearly finished knotting together her fishing net, and I hope it does its task and finds a fish or two to satisfy her. She still whispers of her strange cravings for salt and dirt and gravel, and Im more concerned than ever. On the other hand, a diet of gravel seems to have done Aliye some good: our dove is roaming cheerfully again, begging for scraps, hopping and attempting to take flight despite her bound wing. In just a few days it will be time to remove her splint. Once more I have the urge to find a scrap of wood, attempt to carve the birds sleek form and the feathered slope of her wing, before we have to return her to her cage. But Im too exhausted, and even with Zedas lamps, the night is far too dark. When I etch the tenth mark on the ark wallten days weve been trapped here, nowI can barely see it at all.
Its darker still when I wake from a few hours restless, though this time dreamless, sleep. I rise and creep carefully between the sleeping forms of my family, down the first rungs of the ladder. Ive barely descended when two thin but strong, muscle-taut arms wrap around me, and a rough hand against my mouth muffles my cry.
Its me, Neima. Jorins lips rest against my ear so that I feel more than hear his words. He lowers his hand and I whirl on him, grabbing his wrist to pull him away from the ladder, from any listening ears, but he lets me lead him only a few feet before he locks in place. Though I tug and tug, he refuses to go any farther. I hesitate and then press my lips to his ear, just as he did to mine, and speak as softly as I can:
Are you mad? They might hear us.
Im going on deck, Neima. His words rush together, faster and faster. Just for a minute. I know its a risk but I swear if I spend one more night breathing this foul
As he speaks his voice rises, still a whisper, but frantic enough that I clamp my hand over his mouth. He does sound half-mad, and it makes me shiver. His head shakes back and forth behind my hand, and then he breaks away from me, moving toward the ladder. I cant stop him. I have no choice but to follow.
The ba-room, ba-room of my heart, the shaking of my limbs, the landing of each footfall on the ladder, all seem loud enough to wake even the tigers and elephants below. But when I surface behind Jorin, were alone, with no noise or presence to greet us beyond the steady drumbeat of the rainfall. Jorin stands with his hands outstretched, head tilted back, mouth wide open to drink in the rain. I want to take in every detail of himthe curve of muscle along his arms, the gleam of his hairbut something seems strange. Off.
I squeeze my eyes shut and open them again before I realize: I can see him. The moon has accomplished what the sun hasnt, these past ten days; it has pierced its way through the ever-present clouds, bringing us light, if only a little. Its muted beams wrap themselves around Jorins form as he heads for the railing and leans over the edge, breathing hard. The look on his face, an expression of longing and terror at oncehead still raised, lips parted, eyes desperately searching the skyseems to touch me the way the moon touches him. It lands on the top of my head and slides down my spine like cold liquid, like another raindrop, but this one is inside my body and it makes me shiver to my bones. Im pulled to his side, where I place my hand atop his.
Its not real. It takes me a moment to realize hes spoken aloud. He turns his face to mine, his eyes sparking in the moonlight. Its a dream. A nightmare. It isnt real. Tell me it isnt real.
I The rain swirls around me, inside me, turning my mind in circles till I dont know what to say. But the words come out. Why did you want to come up here, then? Dont you see its as bad here as it is down below? Theres no escape, nothing left, were all doom
Jorins warm, insistent lips close over mine, chasing away the rest of my words, my thoughts. I gasp and he takes my breath into him, his lips forcing mine open, pulling me deeper and deeper until
I push away. Jorin, what are you doing?
He grabs my wrists, his fingers tight and surprisingly hot around my bones. Dont you see? Though he mirrors my words from a moment ago, his voice has a lightness, a giddiness to it that frightens me. Nothing matters now. We can do whatever we want. What we need.
I look into his eyes again, and I do see need there. I feel it in his burning grasp, and I know
Jorin cares for me. Has always cared for me. He didnt kiss me simply because Im here for the taking, as Kenaan did. Ive always understood, deep inside, that the light in Jorins eyes when he looks my way is more than friendship. Perhaps he even loves me
and I love him too, but as a friend. Only as a friend. Right? For me to return his advances now it wouldnt be fair to him. He needs me, and I needa friend. A human presence. A hand to hold mine, a pair of lips to press against my own
If I kiss Jorin again, Ill be making a promise. A promise Im not sure Im prepared to offer, much less keep. I turn my head away
and the want, the need rises inside me again, forcing aside all thoughts of being fair and reasonable. Just as before, when Father made his terrible confession, when Kenaan helped heal our dove, Im overcome with the thought that everything is wrong, upside down, broken. The wanting consumes me, until I would do anything, anything to turn things right once again. Only nownow I know how to make the world whole, if only for a moment.
In one swift movement, I pivot back toward Jorin and press my lips to his.
Id swear the rain grows stronger as our mouths open, tongues meet, hands roam and clutch at each others arms and shoulders and necks. Water whirls around us, slams into us from all sides, forcing us closer and closer together until our edges dissolve and we become one thing, one seeking, reaching, desiring being. The rain can go on forever, can pelt us like stones, break us to pieces. I dont care, so long as I can stay like this.
The drumming of the rain rises to a roar, the heat of Jorins hands and lips pulls an answering fire from inside me, and out of the rush of noise and emotion comes the voice:
So theres an extra rat on board, I see. A large one.
In one instant, the sounds and sensations and warmth fall away. I dont want to turn toward the voice, but my body moves as if jerked by a string.
Standing before us, the moonlight illuminating his face so we can make out every curve of his sneering smile, is my cousin. Kenaan.

***

I stare at the oil lamp in my fathers hands. I focus on the quivering flame and try my best not to look up at Fathers drawn, exhausted face, cast alternately in shadow and light. As for the other faces, the figures standing in shadowNoah and Ham, Japheth and Kenaan all gathered near Father, Jorin facing the men with as much distance as he can get between them, Mother with a stern arm on my shoulder and the other women behind herI cant make out their features at all. Voices come out of blackness, making the words even more frightening:
Believe me, from Jorin, I never meant to deceive you all. He sounds as steady and confident as Ive ever heard him, his words betraying no hint of the terror he must feel inside. Thats good; if he acts like he deserves to be here, perhaps he will convince the others as well. But before he can go on, Hams harsher voice cuts in:
Of course he meant to trick us, and now he will try to destroy us. A pause, and then, He is Munzirs son.
Munzirs son, Noah nearly growls, and my every muscle tenses. Why did Ham have to remind him? My gaze darts toward Kenaans dark form; if he reveals just what Jorin and I were doing on deck, then all, all will be lost. The next voice, though, is not Kenaans but my fathers:
Father, he speaks directly to Noah, it is late, and weve all had quite a shock. We should wait till morning, clear our heads and
We do not need to wait, Noah breaks in. We cannot wait. Munzir has already attempted to destroy the ark once, and we stood against him. I believe He stops, seems to falter, and my breath catches; but then he continues, his voice even stronger than before. I believe that Munzirs attack was a test, sent by God so we could prove our faith to Him. We passed that test, and now the Lord has sent us another. Noah pauses to swallow, a thick, clogging sound that I can almost feel in my own throat. Munzirs son cannot remain on this ark. He is not pure, as we are. We must cast him over the side, and let God decide his fate.
No! The word is out before I can stop it, and Mother gasps and smacks her hand against my mouth. It seems even darker, now, than it was a moment ago, certainly much too dark to see, but somehow I know Grandfathers eyes are on me as he says,
It must be done. Tonight.

A Note on Capitalization

Opinions differ on the capitalization of the word god when referring to the Judeo-Christian God. One take is that the Judeo-Christian God is a proper noun, and should therefore always be capitalized, while the word god referring to, say, a Greek or Roman god is not a proper noun and should not be capitalized. A differing opinion is that capitalization of God implies belief, so if a character cries out, Oh my God!, the use of capitalization indicates the characters religious belief. I tend to agree with the former of the two optionsthat the Judeo-Christian God, as a proper noun, should be capitalized regardless of a characters or authors beliefsand therefore Ive chosen to capitalize the word God in this novel. On the other hand, I do believe that the capitalization of he, him, etc. in reference to God connotes belief. Therefore, I have capitalized he, him, etc. used to refer to God only in Noahs dialogue. Since my narrator, Neima, is less sure about the existence of the one God, I have not capitalized he, him, or his referring to God in her narration.
Ultimately, Forty Days is a work of imagination and storytelling. My intention is to examine a traditional tale in a new way, not to make a definitive religious statement.
