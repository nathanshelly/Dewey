Dear General Casey,
Sir, I write to alert you to a scandalous act of treachery, during time of war, by the portly cinematographer Michael Moore. On his website yesterday he posted an open letter to President Obama on the subject of General Stanley McCrystal. He said:
Let me be blunt: We love our kids in the armed services, but we f*#&in' hate these generals, from Westmoreland in Vietnam to, yes, even Colin Powell for lying to the UN with his made-up drawings of WMD...
(http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/mikes-letter/open-letter-president-obama-michael-moore)
Please find enclosed $20, which I hope you will use towards the prosecution of this unpatriotic scoundrel. 
Moores gripe appears to be that our military leaders often appear to be mendacious dissemblers.
But what would happen to morale if general officers blurted out that Iraq is the worst hell disaster in US history or Afghanistan an endless, pointless, mind-numbingly futile meat grinder?
Yours Sincerely
Andy Bain
PS. The Rolling Stone article, which led to General McCrystals defenestration, is a national disgrace too. How can we defeat illiterate peasants in the third world when unwashed hippies in this country are allowed to pen, The general's staff is a handpicked collection of killers, spies, geniuses, patriots, political operators and outright maniacs?

Washington, D.C. 20505

Dear Sir, 
Has the publication of an un-American diatribe entitled, Dismantling the Empire  Americas Last Best Hope by Professor Chalmers Johnson, been brought to your attention?
The book by, the New York publisher Henry Holts imprint, Metropolitan is a predictable Quasi-Marxist assault on all things American.
However, on page 87, discussing the movie Charlie Wilsons War an extraordinary, puerile attack is made on the Central Intelligence Agency. Johnson writes,
[The Film] makes the U.S. government look as if it is populated by a bunch of whoring, drunken sleazebags, so in that sense it is accurate enough!!!
Mr. Panetta, how can we successfully operate a clandestine service and recruit young people as agents when ex-employees blurt out classified information?
Please find enclosed $10 to deal with Professor Johnson. I believe our contacts in Egypt know how to deal with unpatriotic elements  but Ill leave the details to you.
Yours sincerely

Dear Pastor Hagee, 
Your amazing new book, Can America Survive ?  10 Prophetic Signs That We Are The Terminal Generation, has had me riveted all week.
I was truly staggered to read on page 17, an al-Qaeda operative was arrested at Ramallah with a tactical nuke strapped to his back. 
Why had I never heard of this before?
Your footnote directed to, Paul Williams, American Hirojima, World Net Daily, September 3, 2005. This is an interview with Paul Williams conducted by Ryan Mauro. In the interview Mr. Williams says,
an al-Qaeda operative was arrested at the checkpoint at Ramallah with a weapon strapped to his back. At first, Israeli intelligence thought that the weapon was a radiological bomb but later confirmed, as reported by Richard Sales (sic) of UPI and other reputable journalists, that it was a tactical nuke.
The Richard Sale article available here-
(http://www.homelandsecurityus.net/WMD/data_and_repo1rts_of_the_suitcase.htm) says this: -
Former Pentagon terrorism expert, Peter Probst, described a radiological bomb as a device with a small explosive core that is encased in radioactive material. "It would not kill a great many people, but it would contaminate a considerable area with radiation," he said.
A U.S. government expert said that the weapon captured by Israel was a backpackHe emphasized it was not a so-called nuclear suitcase bomb.
But former CIA counter-terrorism official Vince Cannistraro [was Chief of  Operations at CIA] has no patience with such accounts: "All talk of bin Laden having a nuclear suitcase bomb is crap," he said.
Pastor Hagee when I told my daughter about this she laughed and said, Daddy, looks like you paid 23 bucks for a fiction book!
John, I will feel like a credulous simpleton if the tactical nuke story is fictitious. I dare say you will too.
Pastor, have you any other proof of the veracity of your claim that a Pakistani in Ramallah had a tactical nuke strapped to his back?
Please find enclosed a SASE and $10 to facilitate a reply.
Yours sincerely

Dear Andy,
On behalf of John Hagee Ministries, we appreciate the support and confidence you have in Pastor Hagee's teachings.
You indicate having readPastor Hagee's last book, "Can America Survive". You believe you have identified an error in the book. You indicate Pastor Hagee erroneously stated on page 17 that "an Al-Quaeda operative was arrested at Ramallah with a tactical nuke strapped to his back". You quote internet website data that your research of this incident showed the weapon was not "a nuclear suitcase bomb". You would like Pastor's explanation.
Please understand that your concerns are important to Pastor Hagee and his staff; but, we just do not have the resources to spare the manpower to research and answer follow upquestions generated by the millions of readers that will be reading this book and other books he has published. Please keep in mind that our resources are limited and need to be directed to our 'mission goal', which is TO REACH THE LOST.

Dear Pastor Hagee, 
Many thanks for your kind letter of Nov. 30
John, the other part of your book, which has been keeping me up nights, is on page17 where you write:
Intelligence experts believe Iran has developed the technology to unleash an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) designed to be used against America in a time of war.
Heres what the EMP does. This electromagnetic blanket does not kill people it kills electrons. In short, it stops every form of electricity instantly and for months, maybe yearsNo lights or refrigerators will work in your home.
KILLS ELECTRONS!!!  Christno TV!?!
This is so alarming you repeat it verbatim on page 66.
Again many thanks for your reply.

PS. John, for the love of God, could you ask your people to stop sending me importuning letters asking for money. Almost every day I get a fat letter asking for donations. Does your church do anything besides raise cash?

Washington, DC 20004-1404

Dear Senator Dole,
I am nursing a bruised ankle after falling off my stool in hysterics while reading your hilarious book of quotations, Great Political Wit. The quote that did the damage was,
Acknowledging his loss in the 1976 presidential primaries, Morris Udall said, The voters have spoken  the bastards!
Another dangerously funny one is, Harry Trumanmade a speech at the Washington Garden Club, he kept referring to the good manure that needed to be used on the flowers. Some society women complained to his wife, Bess. Couldnt you get the President to say fertilizer? they asked. Mrs. Truman replied, Heavens no, it took me twenty-five years to get him to say manure.
Senator, I admit I was one of those who thought you were, a gloweringsourpuss. I stand corrected.
Bob, I saw you on WRAL saying a few words about the passing of Jesse Helms. You said, Senator Helmsnever forgot to be civil and courteous to someone on the other side of the issue.
This got me thinking that there may be a book in uncivil quotations? It could be called something like, Jesus, You Cant Say That!!
We could quote Senator Helms, enraged at gays in the military saying, Clinton better not show up here {Fort Bragg, NC] without a bodyguard or Jesse fulminating that, There is not one single case of AIDS in this country that cannot be traced in origin to sodomy. Or how about Jesses quip about the University of North Carolina (UNC) being, The University of Negroes and Communists? We could fill a small book just with Jesses aphorisms - homosexuals are, degenerateweak, morally sick wretches.
If you think such a book is feasible Id like to get in on it. Please accept the enclosed a $20 as an initial investment. There is plenty more where that came from. Just let me know how much we will both have to invest.
Support Mr. Cheney and Mr. Bush
Sincerely
Andy Bain

Washington, DC 20009-1317

Dear Christopher,
Like you I am, a drink sodden Ex-Trotskyist (Glasgow Branch of the International Marxist Group) popinjay now soaking up the sun in the heart of the Imperialist beast!
I recently borrowed your wonderfully prolix book on Thomas Jefferson  Author of America from my public library. Unfortunately, on returning it, a busybody librarian noticed that I had, rather impertinently, appended to your name on the title page the message, is a warmongering arsehole.
The ridiculous woman has had me banned from the whole library system.
I told her that I was writing to you and had every confidence that you, as an admirer of the US Constitution, the Bill of Rights and particularly the 1st Amendment on Free Speech, would be outraged by her crude attempt at censorship.
Christopher, could you drop me a line, in the SAE, confirming that you do not consider my actions as, an egregious defacement of County property but an exercise in vibrant free expression. My library card depends on it.
Yours sincerely
Andy Bain
PS I enclose $20. Have a drink on me! (Are you a single malt man like me?)
PPS It occurs to me that the proffer of an alcoholic libation might be construed as a feeble attempt at a bribe!! Do not hesitate to return the cash if you consider it an attempt to suborn you (I will not be offended - remember I am Scottish).

REPLY FROM HITCHENS
To Whom It May Concern
I understand that Mr Andy Bain has been deprived of the use of the Charlotte library system for scribbling some abuse of me on the title page of my biography of Thomas Jefferson.
I am writing to say that I think such punishment is excessive. Had he torn out a page, or otherwise made the volume unusable by another reader, then I think that he would have offended gravely. But such was evidently neither the intention nor effect of what he did.
I would therefore ask you to reconsider your decision, and tell you that I feel neither personally offended nor outraged in my capacity as an opponent of the desecration of books. Surely some more trifling penalty can be found for such a minor infraction?
Should you wish to contact me directly, my co-ordinates are as follows.

I dont care about myself, of course, but I think in general its a mistake, if not an offense, to deface social property.
Perhaps you know the amusing history of Joe Orton in this respect: its in a book called Prick Up You Ears by John Lahr.

Dear Christopher,
Many thanks for your reply of the 10.X.07. 
I was not aware of the pranks of the playwright Joe Orton. Apparently he would, subtly modify the cover art or the blurbs before returning [books] to the library. A volume of poems by John Betjeman, for example, was returned to the library with a new dust jacket featuring a photograph of a nearly naked, heavily tattooed middle-aged man. Brilliant.
He also stole prints from books to decorate his flat. He was charged with five counts of theft and malicious damage to more than seventy books and was jailed for six months!!
Ironically, the books modified by Orton are now the most valuable books in Islington library.
I have just returned from a rather unpleasant interview with the Director of Libraries. In a truly Orwellian twist they checked all the books I have borrowed in the last year and, a la Orton, have found almost sixty other illicit epigrams.
Around General Colin Powells name on the title page of his biography Soldier I had appended, In front of a Global TV audience of two billion, [Colin Powell] became the biggest liar in History.
In Lou Dobbs War on the Middle Class I had written, Lou Dobbs is a podgy xenophobic moron. Childish I know.
And in Max Boots execrable Savage Wars of Peace: Small wars and the rise of American power I put, MAX BOOTis a fkin warmonger. Read Para. 2 Page 321 and save yourself the trouble of reading this buffoons scribblings. The relevant Para is, A decade later, when Bushs son became president, the Iraqi dictator was still developing weapons of mass destruction 
I showed the Director your letter describing my conduct as, a minor infraction and drew his attention to the proclivities of Joe Orton. But to no avail.
Christopher, to prevent being banned from every library in the Carolinas, they are demanding that I pay for all the books that have been defaced i.e. $1200.
As I am currently in what Comrade Marx called the reserve army of labour i.e. unemployed, this will be vexatious.
In the circumstances, could you see your way to returning my $20 as a contribution towards 1st Amendment rights? Better still; as a famous upholder of free speech would you consider the contribution of a trifling sum towards my fighting fund?
Yours sincerely
Andy Bain
PS I have my own copy of your latest book, God is not Great. If I add to it, your signed epistle To Whom It May Concern it occurs to me that the book might be quite valuable. Would you object to me selling them on e-bay?  I desperately need money to pay, what may be, the largest library fine in history!

PS Have you heard about the wonderful Librarian Ray Martin? (Quoted in Michael Shermers Why People believe Weird Things, P. 138) 
He wrote a guide for Christians called, Reviewing and Correcting Encyclopedias. He wrote, [Encyclopedias]represent the philosophies ofhumanists. This is obvious by the bold display of pictures that are used to illustrate painting, art and sculptureone of the areas that needs correction is immodesty due to nakedness and posture. This can be corrected by drawing clothes on the figures or blotting out entire pictures with a magic markerWhen sections needing correction are too thick, paste the pages together

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am the newly appointed secretary of Charlotte for Responsible American Power a non-partisan citizens group which seeks to raise awareness on our countrys immense power and our concomitant responsibilities.
We would like to invite General Colin Powell, USA (Ret.) to address our inaugural meeting, which will take place, provisionally, at Charlottes North Carolina Performing Arts Center on Sat. 26th August 2006 at 7.30pm.
We anticipate an audience of approximately 500.
I would be grateful if you could let me know ASAP as to the Generals availability (we can be flexible on the date) and normal fee.
As to the subject of General Powells address, we will be guided by his advice but our committee has asked me to suggest the following possibilities;
Lies and fabrications they didnt tell me about.

I was deeply moved when you wrote on page 197, America today would bea far safer place ifwe had fire-bombed Kabul and Khandahar, demolished whatever ruins were left, and sown salt over the length and width of both sites.
I showed the above passage to my daughter, a university student, (whose judgement has been addled by atheism and rap music) and told her you had been Chief of the CIAs bin Laden Tracking Unit. Of course she deprecated your robust strategy.
She said, Kabul is a city of three million souls, is this Christian nutcase really advocating the immolation of millions of women and children?
Damn right he is, I replied.

Dear Mr Klinghoffer,
I have been reading your wonderful book, How Would God Vote  Why the Bible Commands You to be a Conservative.
I am mystified by your exegesis about contamination by birth, menstruation, seminal emission and sleep. However, you are sound on abortion (against), lesbians (against) and evolution (against) so it was with shock that I reached Page 142 and read the stunning, As I was writing this book, I changed my mind about gun controlI admit I was wrong about gun control. On this the liberals may be right !!
Talk about a kick in the teeth. As you begin writing the book you have a rock solid biblical explanation as to why the National Rifle Association is a Godly organization but half way through, just because a nutjob shoots 32 people at Virginia Tech, you pull a biblical explanation out of your ass arguing the diametrically opposite position!?!
That new position appears to be that not enough people in the US are culturally religious. gun control comes downto a question about the nature of our society. Is it religious enough to merit free access to fire arms? Can Americans be trusted?
Quoting the catholic Glenmary Research Center in Nashville you claim that Americans who actually practice their religion, as distinct from those who merely identify themselves as religious, is only 49.6 percent. Therefore, you write, God would vote to review our nations laws granting such freedom of gun ownership.
I was bamboozled. Then, thank G-d, I spotted a simple arithmetical mistake.
The 49.6 percent of religious practitioners is made up of 47.4 percent Christians and 2.2 percent Jews. David, the dopey people at Glenmary have left out all those millions of Muslims who conscientiously practice their religion. 
But, David, you are the biblical scholar not me. Do you think I am right on this one? Can we have handguns after all?

Dear Mr. LaPierre,
Can I urgently bring to your attention the writings of one David Klinghoffer, author of the recent book, How Would God Vote? - Why the Bible Commands You to be a Conservative and a Senior Fellow at the, normally dependable, creationist Discovery Institute?
I was innocently reading and enjoying the book until Page 142 where Klinghoffer drops this bombshell, As I was writing this book, I changed my mind about gun controlI admit I was wrong about gun control. On this the liberals may be right !!
Wayne, I was cleaning a Smith and Wesson Model 19 blued steel Combat Magnum when I read this and nearly shot my foot off in surprise.
This renegade is hoodwinking honest folk into reading his tract. The title leads unsuspecting readers to expect absolutely mainstream conservative positions. He is sound on Immigration (against) sound on Climate Change (Liberal propaganda) and sound on taxation (an abomination  especially when extorted by Democrats). So it will bewilder and confuse any 2nd Amendment supporters who naively stumble into this liberal trap.
An Alert Bulletin to all NRA members advising them of this lunatics apostasy seems essential. A sharply worded letter, from you, to the Discovery Institute denouncing this poltroon also seems called for. But you are the politics guy not me. I will leave the details to you.
Sincerely
Andy Bain

Dear Mr. LaPierre,
 I was delighted to receive in this mornings mail my brand new NRA membership card.
I have been showing it off to all my liberal friends who are aghast. They think I have gone off my head.
The NRA decal has caused a bit of domestic strife as I strategically placed it to slightly overlap my good lady wifes Obama 08 sign on the truck. She claims it is preposterous for two vegetarians who dont own a firearm to be traipsing about with an NRA bumper sticker on their vehicle. The poor woman is clueless as to the necessity of a well regulated militia.
Wayne, am I fully paid up? I thought annual membership of the NRA cost hundreds of dollars and viewed the 20 bucks I sent you as simply a down payment. Let me know if I owe any outstanding monies.
Also, Wayne, did you fire off a coruscating epistle to the morons at The Discovery Institute specifically the cretin Klinghoffer who now thinks Liberals are right about gun control?
I look forward to hearing from you.

Dear General (Mad Dog) Mattis,

You are my kind of general! So what if the liberal pansies are shocked by your robust ejaculations? My pacifist wife nearly fainted when I showed her some of your martial aphorisms: -
Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.
I come in peace. I didnt bring artillery. But Im pleading with you, with tears in my eyes: If you f--k with me, Ill kill you all.
You go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slap women around for five years because they didnt wear a veil. You know, guys like that aint got no manhood left anyway. So its a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them. Actually its quite fun to fight them, you know. Its a hell of a hoot. Its fun to shoot some people. Ill be right up there with you, I like brawling.
James, have you seen the mendacious article by Michael Gerson in this mornings WAPO which libels you? Please find enclosed $10 towards your legal costs as I am sure you will sue Gersons ass off. He writes: -
During the worst of the Iraq war, Mattis tried to persuade an Iraqi that America would not cut and run. "I told him I had found a little piece of property down on the Euphrates River and I was going to have a retirement home built there.
James from the above aphorisms it is transparent that you are a consummate practitioner of President Nixons Madman Strategy, i.e. make the enemy believe they are dealing with a maniac. But the point is to appear dangerously unstable not, as Gerson implies, completely bonkers!
Yours sincerely

Andy Bain

General, if you decide not to proceed with litigation against Gerson buy a couple of bullets, on me, and have some fun!!

Jane Mayer
The New Yorker
4 Times Square
New York, NY 10036

Dear Ms. Mayer,
Just finished your superb book, The Dark Side  The Inside Story of How The War on Terror Turned into A War on American Ideals. Bravo!
Aside from the Vice President, and that sophomoric ignoramus Bush, the main culprit responsible for all the twisted torture was, according to you, the foul-mouthed, amoral, thug David Addington, Cheneys chief of staff. 
I especially liked the lawyer you quote on page 51 who wondered of Addington, How did this lunatic end up running the country?
Jane, I have a question. On Page 9 you write, America [has] done more than any nation on earth to abolish torture and other violations of human rights.
This is rather a startling declamation. Especially since on page 144 you write, He [Cheney] was particularly impressed with the Vietnam War-era Phoenix Program. Critics, including military historians, have described it as a program of state sponsored torture and murder. (Emphasis added)
And, as a result of reading your book I had a look at Human Rights Firsts document, Tortured Justice, 2008. On page 28 they write,
at least by the 1980s, the CIA had begun developing offensive techniques [coercive interrogation techniques such as water boarding and stressful noises] based on the North Korean interrogation studies as well as its own experiments on interrogation. Also by the 1980s, CIA and Green Beret trainers reportedly began training Latin American militaries in similar techniques in places such as El Salvador, Guatemala, Ecuador, and Peru, and through its School of the Americas at Fort Benning, Georgia.
As you know Pinochet, The Shah of Iran, the Argentine Junta, the Greek Generals and Mubarack, were all robust torturers and our close allies.
Jane, to avoid appearing like a feeble-minded, dopey, poltroon you may wish to consider removing the reference to the US trying to abolish torture in your next edition!
Still the book is invaluable and since I borrowed it from the library I enclose $10 for you personally (Dont give it to The New Yorker  an effete, snobbish organ I abhor) if you think I should pay the full price of $27.50 just let me know.

Dear Andy,
Thanks for your great letter, and for the cash!
Heres my thought on the sentence you circled for criticism: its not that the U.S. has not supported or engaged in torture previously, but in the Bush years, the difference was that it became official, sanctioned, legal policy of the U.S.
That is the difference.
Anyway. Many Thanks, Best

Dear Mr. Urschel,
My family had the immense pleasure of visiting your museum on the 1st of October.  After our tour we stood for a moment admiring the 45 words of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, etched into the stone panel overlooking Pennsylvania Ave.
Imagine our shock when members of your staff suddenly draped a gigantic banner over the 1st Amendment which blared in enormous letters, "MR. OBAMA: END THESE FUCKING WARS! WAR IS THE OBSCENITY."
I know you media types are liberal but this is ridiculous!
I immediately covered my granddaughters eyes but I fear she read the offending aphorism anyway. My grandson (10) definitely did because he began to laugh hysterically and, encouraged by some adolescents, began chanting, End these Fucking Wars.
Joe, we hurried the children away but as you can imagine our day out was irretrievably spoiled. The children are still traumatized. In the circumstances I assume you will  feel obliged to refund our entrance fee?

Dear Mr. Burns,
Are you aware that a vicious article about you has appeared in Salon.com penned by one Glenn Greenwald?
Please find enclosed $10, which it would give me immense pleasure if you would use towards suing the author of this disreputable attack.
Greenwald writes, there is now a major, coordinated effort underway to smear WikiLeaks' founder, Julian Assange, and to malign his mental healththe low point of this smear campaign was led by TheNew YorkTimes' John Burns, who authored a sleazy hit piece on Assange-- filled with every tawdry, scurrilous tabloid rumor about him
Apparently, faced with hundreds of thousands of documents vividly highlighting stomach-turning war crimes and abuses -- death squads and widespread torture and civilian slaughter all as part of a war he admired for years and which his newspaper did more than any other single media outlet to enable -- John Burns and his NYT editors decided that the most pressing question from this leak is this: what's Julian Assange really like?
Of course, even for a borderline-sociopath, the guilt that one must experience for having enabled and cheered on aWar that led to the amount of human suffering evident in these documents must be immense. The temptation to smear the messenger is undoubtedly a strong one. But no matter how much distracting sleaze Burns and his newspaper wallow in and spew at Assange, that damn spot won't come out.
The New York TimesServing the Government's interests, siding with government and military officials, and attacking government critics is what they do.That's their role. That's what makes them the "establishment media." Beyond that, the last thing they want is renewed recognition of what an evil travesty the attack on Iraq was, given the vital role they know they played in helping to bring it about and sustain it for all those yearsAnd by serving as the 2010 version of the White House Plumbers -- acting as attack dogs against the Pentagon's enemies
Sleazy, borderline-sociopath, attack dog!!!
John, this is monstrous!! They are trying to portray you as a demented, sycophantic, toady rather than a serious, honest journalist.

Dear Secretary of State,
Are you aware that the new autobiography by General Hugh Shelton, Without Hesitation - the Odyssey of an American Warrior makes a damaging claim about one of his colleagues at the Whitehouse and that various reptiles on the World Wide Web are implying the culprit is you?
Shelton claims that, At one of my very first breakfasts (Oct. 1997)one of the Cabinet members present leaned over to me and said, Hughwhat we really need in order to go in and take out Saddam is a precipitous eventCould you have one of our U-2s fly low enoughand slow enoughso as to guarantee that Saddam could shoot it down?
The hair on the back of my neck bristled, my teeth clenched, and my fists tightened. I was so mad I was about to explode. I looked across the table, thinking about the pilot in the U-2 and responded, Of course we can . . . which prompted a big smile on the officials face.
You can? was the excited reply.
Why, of course we can, I countered. Just as soon as we get your ass qualified to fly it, I will have it flown just as low and slow as you want to go.
Madeleine, this portrays you as a stonehearted, Machiavellian, hoodlum.
It is already being linked to your, admitted, blunder on 60 Minutes when Lesley Stahl asked, "We have heard that half a million children have died [as a result of sanctions on Iraq]. I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it?" 
You replied: "I think this is a very hard choice, but the price  we think the price is worth it.
However, that was Iraqis, about which no one knows or cares in the US. Much more damaging is the accusation that you contemplated squandering the life of one of our heroes to manufacture a squalid little war with Saddam!
Denial and litigation are ineluctable. Please find $10 towards the legal fees. If we move fast we can nip this in the bud.
If I can be of any further assistance do not hesitate to contact me.

Congressman Ron Paul
203 Cannon House Office Building
Washington, DC 20515

Dear Congressman,
You provided a foreword for Judge Napolitanos little book, Lies The Government Told you. Well done.
The Judge is sound on the Iraq War (against), Torture (against) and the War on Drugs (against). But I thought I had better give you a heads up on his chapter on Gun Control in case you quote him and find out later that his positions on firearms are crapulent.
On page 105 he writes, Guns are used defensively (by US citizens) more than two million times per year
Prima facie this is bonkers! The US would be like the Wild West with citizens pulling pistols out of handbags and blasting away in the malls every week.
Napolitano bases this statistic on the junk science of one John R. Lott author of More Guns, Less Crime.
Michelle Malkin, no lily-livered liberal, writing on Townhall.com says -
The most disturbing chargeis that Lott fabricated a study claiming that 98 percent of defensive gun uses involved mere brandishing, as opposed to shooting. When Lott cited the statistic peripherally on page three of his book, he attributed it to "national surveys." In the second edition, he changed the citation to "a national survey that I conducted.
Lott claims to have lost all of his data due to a computer crash. He financed the survey himself and kept no financial records. He has forgotten the names of the students who allegedly helped with the survey and who supposedly dialed thousands of survey respondents long-distance from their own dorm rooms using survey software Lott can't identify or produce. Assuming the survey data was lost in a computer crash, it is still remarkable that Lott could not produce a single, contemporaneous scrap of paper proving the survey's existence, such as the research protocol or survey instrument.
Lott now admits he used a fake persona, "Mary Rosh," to post voluminous defenses of his work over the Internet. "Rosh" gushed that Lott was "the best professor that I ever had." She/he also penned an effusive review of More Guns, Less Crime on Amazon.com: "It was very interesting reading and Lott writes very well." (Lott claims that one of his sons posted the review in "Rosh's" name.)
But Lott's invention of Mary Rosh to praise his own research and blast other scholars is beyond creepy. And it shows his extensive willingness to deceive to protect and promote his work.
But it wasn't an anti-gun zealot who unmasked Rosh/Lott. It was Julian Sanchez, a staffer at the libertarian Cato Institute, which staunchly defends the Second Amendment. And it was the conservative Washington Times that first reported last week on the survey dispute
Ron, this guy Lott may be a charlatan and the Judge may be a shyster who doesnt fact check.
Dont trust a word they say.
Ron Paul for President in 2012!!

Dear Mr. Gingrich,
Just read your interview in National Review Online with Bob Costa. Bravo Newt! 
Speaking about Dinesh DSouzas new book, The Roots of Obamas Rage you say,
DSouza has made a stunning insight into Obamas behavior 
[Obama] is so outside our comprehension, that only if you understand Kenyan, anti-colonial behavior, can you begin to piece together [his actions]? 
This is a person who is fundamentally out of touch with how the world works, who happened to have played a wonderful con, as a result of which he is now president 
Obama [has a] worldview that is fundamentally wrong about realityif you look at the continuous denial of reality [it] is just factually insane.
Of course the liberals have gone mad! Eugene Robinson in WAPO writes 
Is Newt Gingrich just pretending to have lost his mind, or has he actually gone around the bend? His lunacy certainly seems genuine enoughThe man'sunhinged.
Richard Capehart calls you a, huckster and xenophobe and Richard Cohen says you, give him the willies.
Maureen Dowd in the NYTs says, 
Newt Gingrich is truly gaga. The 67-year-old former speaker is more unbridled than ever.
And Eric Alterman in The Nation describes you as Crazy and one of the, demagogues who prey on the ignorance of the uninformed.

Senior Judicial Analyst
Fox News
1211 Avenue of the Americas, 
New York, NY 10036

Dear Judge Napolitano,
Reading, and loving, your latest book Lies the Government Told You.
On page 105, I was flabbergasted to learn that, Guns are used defensively (by US citizens) more than two million times per year
I showed the above quote to my 17-year-old daughter, who is studying Statistics, all she said was, Junk Science.
I replied, Are you seriously trying to suggest that a US Judge is waffling like a moron in a serious work of jurisprudence?
I could prove it in ten minutes, she said.
Andrew, unfortunately, I think she has. Like this: -
Your footnote No. 19 directs to Robert A. Levy, Cato Institute he directs to John R. Lott Jr. the source of the 2 million figure.
Wikipedia has this on Mr. Lott, 
Lott created and used "Mary Rosh" as a fake persona to defend his own works posing as Rosh, [Lott] not only praised his own academic writing, but also called himself "the best professor I ever had".
he praised himself while posing as one of his former students"Rosh" was used to post a favorable review of More Guns, Less Crime on  Amazon.com. Lott has claimed that the "Rosh" review was written by his son and wife.
"I probably shouldn't have done itI know I shouldn't have done itLott told the Washington Post in 2003.
At www.JohnLott.org you can find the raw data from the survey Lott conducted in 2002. 
In a telephone survey run by 8 students (using their own phones?) 1015 people were asked if they had been physically threatened in the last year. 114 said they had. That 114 were asked if they had used a gun defensively  13 said yes.
So 1.125% of the survey had used a gun defensively. There were 206.99 million adults over 20 at the time, ergo 206,990,000 X 1.125% = 2,328,637 defensive gun uses in 2002.
Andrew, given the minute size of the sample, even I can see that this is puerile.
That 114 people, reported being menaced a total of 467 times in the last year!! Even the young students reported that they suspected 23 cases of fabricated reporting.
Judge, I suspect that you, like me, feel like a credulous simpleton now. My daughter taunted me,  Dad youve paid 25 bucks for a work of fiction.
Andrew, do you have any other source for the 2 million statistic other than the mountebank Lott?
Please find enclosed a SASE (and $10  cant have the judiciary working gratis) to facilitate a reply.
Yours sincerely
Andy Bain

Dear Michael,
I am reading your hilarious (and erudite) book, Rules for Radical Conservatives  Beating the Left at its Own Game To Take Back America. It is laugh out loud funny and I have a dictionary to hand to deal with the intentional verbosity!
Your humor very much reminds me of my old Daddys dry wit.
On page 22-23 you recount the battleat Kent State in May 1970.
The students were chanting, Pigs off campusThe kids threw rocks and empty tear-gas canisters. And then the Guard fired back  not with rocks but with real, live bullets. In thirteen seconds, sixty-seven rounds were fired and when the shooting stopped, four kids lay dead.
The minute those young Guardsmen turned their M1s on the crowd, and the student protesters got an ugly lesson in the first rule of protest  never throw rocks at guys with guns
I remember well my daddys reaction when he saw the TV pictures of the shootings, he said, Whats this country coming to? The National Guard was just 100 yards from those kids(pause)and they only got four?
We all sat round the TV watching reruns of the students lying dead on the grass roaring with laughter at my Daddys witticism.
I showed those two pages to my student daughter and told her about her Granddaddys joke. 
She said, What kind of human being would gloat over the execution of 19 year old kids? Even this twisted nut job Walsh couldnt have been in favor of killing even more students that day!
Michael, I have bet her $20 that the only thing you deprecate about that day was the atrocious aim of the guardsmen!

"The British suffered a defeat in IraqI think it was a huge mistake to pull out of Basra and to go out to the airfield and to leave the people of Basra to be subjected to the Iranian surrogates who brutalized them, intimidated them, terrorized them.
My neighbor Bill, an ex-pat Brit, brought it to my attention. He was just in here foaming at the mouth. He said,
The Iranian surrogates Keane is talking about are Iraqis i.e. the people who live in Iraq  and with 1 million Iraqis dead, who knows how many maimed, and 4 million Iraqis displaced these cheeky bloody Iraqis should know that brutalizing them, intimidating them and terrorizing them is our job.

Just finished your magisterial book, Fiasco, The American Military Adventure in Iraq. Thank you for writing it.
I was amazed that you were able to find gallows humor among the carnage. On Page 425 you recounted the story of your WAPO colleague Jackie Spinner who spent nine months in Iraq. 
wrote, One day near the Abu Ghraib prison, two men tried to shove the small, reserved Spinner into a car. Confusing her beginners Arabic phrases, she tried to yell that she was a journalist, but instead shouted, Im a vegetarianwhich was also true, but irrelevant.
I also enjoyed your yarn about the Lt. Col. who, baulked at the idea he would have to attend a course, after three blood stained and futile years fighting an insurgency, on counterinsurgency theory. Youre shittin me! he declared. The reluctant soldier/ students name?  Lt. Col. Patrick Looney!
Thomas, you couldnt make this stuff up?
But, I didnt know whether to laugh or cry when I read this on page 431, the administration wont admit to propounding tenuous links between Iraq and anti-US terrorism. This is arguably a greater error, (than refusing to admit it was wrong on WMD) because it may have contributed to the problem of some US troops conflating the war in Iraq and the 9/11 attacks and led some to treat Iraqis as despised terrorists rather than as the prize in the war.
The NYT recently reported that 50% of Americans, up from the previously ludicrous 36%, now think Iraq was involved in the 9/11 attacks.
Thomas, how can we defend ourselves when half of our fellow citizens have their heads up their ass?

Woodward is the uncontested king of crony journalism[h]is Washington Post colleague Thomas E. Ricks would give his remaining baby-maker to have the kind of clout, fame, and success that Woodward has. (Ricks sacrificed his other one to become head hagiographer to General David Petraeus)
[embedded] reporters suffered from a form of Stockholm syndrome, where they so over-sympathized with their subjects that their objectivity vanished like a corporate pension fundI strongly suspect this was part of what seduced Tom Ricks into David Petraeuss bedrollHis books on the Iraq war did pretty well, and NBC fops like Chris Matthews and David Gregory kissed up to him on cameraBut at core Ricks will never be more than a once credible journalist who turned slut-puppy for the Long Warmongers.
Tom, I take it you will sue? Please find enclosed $10, which I would be honored if you would use towards your legal fees. (What the hell is a slut-puppy anyway?)
Far from being a hagiographer of U.S. generalship, as the ridiculous Huber claims, in Fiasco you expose the military command as a bunch of incompetent, timeserving, balloons. Who can forget your rapier like evisceration of General Ray Odierno  The Desert Ox  who you reveal, almost single-handedly provoked the insurgency in central Iraq by his moronic, berserker, violence.
OK, in your next book The Gamble you rather change your tune and Ray is portrayed as a cross between Clauswitz and Gandhi. But after a million dead Iraqis, 4000 dead and 30,000 maimed American kids even the dullest of generals will eventually recognize when they are up an excrementary channel without a method of propulsion.

Dear Sir,
Are you aware of the vile attack on you by Bill Maher in the preposterous on-line website the Huffington Post? Writing about the egregious Obama tax hike he says:-
Steve Forbes said that Obama, quote "believes from his inner core that people... above a certain income have more than they should have and that many probably have gotten it from ill-gotten ways." 
Which they have. 
Steve Forbes, of course, came by his fortune honestly: he inherited it from his gay egg-collecting, Elizabeth Taylor fag-hagging father, who inherited it from his father. Of course then they moan about the inheritance tax, how the government took 55% percent when Daddy died -- which means you still got 45% for doing nothing more than starting out life as your father's pecker-snot.
Maher reveals himself to be a homophobic, communist, vulgarian.

Washington, DC 20500

Dear Rahm,
Have you been alerted to the truly monstrous open letter which appeared on Michael Moores blog at his demented website on Sept. 6th?
Litigation is inexorable and I would consider it an honor if you accepted the enclosed $10 towards your legal fees.
Here is some of what the lunatic wrote. 
Dear Rahm Emanuel:
Happy Fuckin' Labor Day! 
I read this week that  according to a new book by Steven Rattner, your administration's former "Car Czar"  during White House meetings about how to save the tens of thousands of jobs that would be lost if GM and Chrysler collapsed, your response was, "Fuck the UAW! (United Auto Workers)
So, let me give you a little fucking lesson (a lesson I happen to know because my fucking uncle was in the sit-down strike that founded the fucking UAW). Before unionsWorking people didn't get to send their kids to college, few were able to own their own fucking home, nobody could take a fucking day off for a funeral or a sick day or they might lose their fucking job.
Then working people organized themselves into unions. The bosses and the companies fucking hated that. In fact, they were often overheard to say, "Fuck the UAW!!!" 
You see, Rahm, when people earn a fucking good wage, they spend it on stuff, which then creates more good paying jobs, and then the middle class grows fucking big. Did you know that back when I was a kid if you had a parent making a union wage, only one parent had to work...Dad had four weeks paid vacation. We all had free health and dental care. And anyone with decent grades went to college and it didn't fucking bankrupt them. 
Then a Republican fired all the air traffic controllers, a Democrat gave us NAFTA and millions of jobs were moved overseas (hey, didn't you work in that White House, too? "Fuck the UAW, baby!"). 
Unions got scared and beaten down, a frat boy became president and, like a drunk out of control, spent all our fucking money and our children's money, too. Fuck. And now your assistant's grandma has to work at fucking McDonald'sI'll bet grandma doesn't say "Fuck the UAW!"
Hey, don't get me wrong, Rahm. I fucking like you. You single-handedly got the House returned to the Dems in 2006. But you and your boss better do something fucking quick to put people back to work. How 'bout making it a crime to take an American job and move it out of the country? 
Or how 'bout arresting some of those Wall Street guys who fucking stole our money, the money that ran the American economy. Now that would take some fucking guts. And maybe, just maybe, that one act of real guts might save your ass come November 2nd.
Oh, I can just hear you now: "Fuck Michael Moore!" No problem. But Fuck the UAW? How 'bout if I just leave off the A and the W? 
Rahm, to use one of your favorite phrases, thats f@#*in retarded. (I see you had to apologize to the chief executive of the Special Olympics after some stoolpigeon ratted you out for using that quip in a private meeting. kin morons!)
Sir, if I can be of any further assistance just let me know.
Yours sincerely
Andy Bain

Dear Mr. Miller,
Read your searing article in todays Washington Post. 
In My Iraq Mistake you wrote, taking stock of Americas role in Iraq, I want to remind you that I blew itI supported the war in 2003 I've been struggling with what my mistake means ever since.
Surely what it means is that your employer, the Washington Post, inevitably supported the criminal carnage in Iraq and as a salaried columnist you could hardly denounce your own bosses as crazed, pusillanimous, warmongers? Had you, recklessly, stood up for peace and justice you would have found your ass out on the street quicker than you could say, bought and paid for wee toady.
That s exactly what happened to Phil Donahue. MSNBC was (like WAPO) a rabid frothing at the mouth, flag-waving, propaganda machine for the Neo-Cons. Although Phils show was more popular than Chris Matthews Hardball the suits decided Phil would be a, difficult public face for NBC in a time of war"!
Result? Americas most respected journalist unceremoniously dumped because he declined to endorse the gratuitous slaughter and maiming of a million innocents.
Matt, I swallowed the bovine excrement from Colin Powell at the UN too and, like you, I feel like a gullible simpleton now.
But, you are the only journalist who has honestly come clean about spouting lethal gibberish in a leading national newspaper. Well Done.
Heres a wager for you. Ill give you ten to one that the WAPO will enthusiastically support the next carnival of carnage (Iran?) and that every hack at WAPO will go along for the slaughter. If, miraculously, one sucker lets their conscience intervene they will be defenestrated from the highest window at WAPO HQ. What do you say? Are we on?
Please find enclosed $10 and a SASE to facilitate your rely.

Washington, D.C. 20318-9999

Dear Admiral Mullen,
Congratulations on the firing of Army Col. Lawrence Sellin, PhD. [the] 61-year old reservist from New Jerseyfrom his job as a staff officer at the International Security Assistance Force Joint Command (ISAF) in Kabul. 
His crime? 
He spilled his guts in an editorial for United Press International (UPI) that, little of substance is really done here[except] endless tinkering with PowerPoint slides to conform with the idiosyncrasies of cognitively challenged generals in order to spoon-feed them information.
Of course, this is not the first time Colonel Sellin has blurted out the truth.
In a UPI article date Feb. 25, 2010 he made the following astonishing statements:
In my 29-year U.S. Army career I have met my share of lap-dog generals and Defense Department officials. I recently noticed that one prominent example was just promoted. Well done. The system workedone does not rise to that level in the military without political acumen, risk awareness -- if not risk aversion -- and a "get-along-by-going-along" attitude.
I often wonder why there are so few general officer resignations on principleone cannot help but question whether this also [is] a convenient excuse for the consummate careerist military-politician. The statements of these "leaders" on controversial issues are often so vague that they easily transition, for example, between administrations with such extraordinarily divergent views of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. It is difficult not to conclude that they are just taking the easy way out.
The dirty little secret in the military is that general officers take care of each other, "choose" each other for promotions and, when things get messy, often keep each other "out of the bursting radius" of plans gone sour.
Mike, this is treachery. No one can fail to draw the conclusion that our Generals are a bunch of timeserving, bootlicking, blockheads!
My question is why wasnt this scoundrel cashiered, court-martialled or shot at dawn?
Please find enclosed $10 and a SASE to facilitate your reply.

Dear Steven Polson,
Can I congratulate you on the charming oil portrait you did of Donald Rumsfeld. I note from your website that you have also painted General Colin Powell, George Tenet of the CIA and are currently doing Condoleezza Rice.
Steven, could I induce you to take a commission to paint me?
I made my pile in the plumbing business and have a rather good, clear, close-up photo of me unblocking a Briggs 1.5 gravity-fed toilet bowl with my bare hands. Like Oliver Crowell, when he had his portrait done, I want, warts and all or I wont pay a farthing.
Which brings me to cost. I see from the DOD website that Mr. Rumsfeld paid $50,000 out of his own pocket for the painting.
But, Steven, youre not dealing with another simpleton. Nice work if you can get it, of coursefair enoughnever give a sucker an even break is the American way, after all. But you are not dealing with a moron this time.
$25,000 is my absolute limit.
Please find enclosed $10 to show my bona fides. Theres plenty more where this came from.

Dear Steven,
You will recall I wrote to you back in June to commission a portrait of myself doing what I love best i.e. unblocking clogged plumbing fixtures.
As I have heard nothing, I assume you have been in Italy all summer vacuuming up a bit of culture. Or have you been nose to the grind stone painting international War Criminals like Dick Cheney?
Or could it be that my first bid of $25,000, not being in your usual price range, has ruffled your feathers a trifle?
OK, fair enough. Ive been in business long enough to know how to haggle. Will $30,000 suit you? But for that Id want Mrs. Bain included in the painting. Though youll have your work cut out trying to make a likeness acceptable to her, I can tell you. I have taken thousands of photos of her and she hasnt like one of them.
As it happens we will be in NYC on the 1st Nov for a week. So unless I hear that it is inconvenient the wife and I will pop through your door at the above address on 2nd Nov. about 10:00 am to finalize details on this painting malarkey.

Dear Mrs. Polson,
Thank you for your kind letter of the 7th.
As you know I had the immense pleasure of speaking to your husband on the phone the other day. My teasing about the outlandish prices he charges for a few dabs of paint obviously touched a raw nerve. 
He related a humorous anecdote about obtaining a quote from a qualified plumber for some work at your house. You were quoted $600 for a job which Mr. Polson completed himself for the paltry sum of $25. The very clear implication being that the entire cohort of US plumbing professionals are, "a bunch of swindling, robbing bastards".
Damn Right!! "Never give a sucker an even break" is, as Ms. Ayn Rand and W.C. Fields pointed out, "the first commandment of American capitalism.
Lori, I can't wait 4 bloomin' years!!
So I have had a portrait in oil done by a local art student for 50 bucks (plus materials). It took her a week to complete including drying time! (None of my business of course but is Steven prone to procrastination and malingering?)The painting is every bit as good as Steven's extortionate 'objets' and I didn't risk bumping into any war criminals during the sittings!

Dear Mr. Medved,
Just put down your tremendous new book, The 5 BIG LIES about American Business  Combating Smears Against the Free-Market Economy. Bravo! 
In a witty and often humorous book you pull no punches quoting crazed liberals: -
Let Wall Street Die: No tax payer bailoutshould go to rescue the growing cesspool of filthy-rich, elite financial managers whose unchecked greed and false sense of entitlement has given this country its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Professor Kurt Hochenauer.
You expose the weak character and personal peccadilloes of Dennis Kozlowski, CEO of the gigantic health care and electronics conglomerate Tyco, who is now serving eight years in the Mid-State Correctional facility in Marcy, New York for twenty two counts of grand larceny.
At Kozlowskis $2 million party in 2001, there was a Big ice sculpture of DavidA waiter is pouring Stoli vodka into his back so it comes out his penis into a crystal glassa huge (naked female figure) cake is brought out with the waiters in togas singing and holding the cake up for all to seeThe tits explode!!
This puerile boorishness even provokes you to comment, [This] reinforce[s] the notion that corporate chieftains constitute a class of selfish, shallow, preposterously pampered, and ludicrously overpaid parasites.
One question if I may?
On page 131 you write, The Gospel According to Matthew (19:24) quotes the enigmatic declaration of Jesus that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.
Michael, whats enigmatic about that?
If I were to say Michael Medved is a pathetic apologist for avarice and selfishness and has about as much chance of getting into heaven as I have of pushing a hippopotamus through the eye of a needle nobody would describe that as enigmatic.
Can you enlighten me? Please find enclosed a SASE and $10  have a vodka on me!

Undoubtedly, you are aware of the scurrilous review of your new book, The Enemy at Home  The cultural Left and Its Responsibility for 9/11, by one Alan Wolfe, which appeared in yesterdays NYT. 
In this unprecedented hatchet job Wolfe wrote, let this decent liberal make perfectly clear how thoroughly indecent Dinesh DSouza is. Like his hero Joe McCarthy, he has no sense of shame. He is a childish thinker and writer tackling subjects about which he knows little to make arguments that reek of political extremism. His book is a national disgrace
Indecentno sense of shamechildish thinkernational disgrace! This is monstrous.
Dinesh, after a close reading, as I understand your book, you are simply exercising your freedom of speech to codify and intellectually underpin the clarity of the Rev. Jerry Falwell when he said, "I really believe that the pagans, and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People For the American Way, all of them who have tried to secularize America.

Dear Mr. Gore,
Just finished your sagacious monograph, The ASSAULT ON REASON. 
You paint an alarming picture of an inert and gullible nation of blobby couch potatoes, glued to television an average of four hours and thirty-five minutes a day collectively devoting a hundred million hours of their lives each week to sensationalist twaddle like the Michael Jackson trial. 
Three-quarters [of us] believed that Saddam Hussein was responsible for attacking us on September 11many Americans still believe that most of the highjackers on September 11 were Iraqis and a third of the population believed that US forces had found WMD and more than 20% believed Iraq had used them during the war.
Al, how can we have a serious debate in the Civic Forum when most of our fellow citizens have their heads up their own ass?
My dopey spouse argues the solution is to reinvigorate Congress to fight the mendacious, warmongering, media. Al, you and I know she is a poor deluded utopian! 
The only way out of the electronic Dark Ages is your simple, visionary idea of replacing the Conglomerate TVof the media Machiavellis with interactive internet TV.  People in pajamas firing off irate e-mails are our last hope; waiting on the Democrats to vote against war and carnage is obviously futile.

Dear Professor Fortunato,
I read your fascinating article on Opus Dei and The Da Vinci Code movie in yesterdays New York Times.
I admit that at first I was somewhat perplexed by your candid admission that, For the record, I do wear a spiked metal band on my leg for a couple of hours a day like the movies murderous Opus Dei numerary, SilasIve even made a point of wearing shorts around (the University?) so that people can see that the thigh band, the cilice, leaves no marks.
However, your explanation of why you wear the apparatus  merely giving money to help the needy is inadequate and patronizing. One key element behind corporal mortification is to feel solidarity with the poor seems eminently sane to me.
Professor, inspired by your example I decided I too would like to show solidarity with the needy. But, frankly I had no idea where one could purchase a cilice. I visited our local Wal-Mart and related to a very helpful lady what I was looking for. Of course she had never heard of such a thing and had some difficulty grasping the concept. When I explained that it was an instrument for corporal mortification, as you can perhaps imagine, she gave me a very strange, sceptical look and suggested I try one of the emporiums out near the airport.
Paul, I enclose $20. Could you send me a cilice? If it is more expensive than this simply let me know and I will send you the balance. If it is less expensive please donate the rest to the needy. Thanking you in advance.

I am a Scottish ex-Trotskyist and neo-Chomskyite. I have been viewing all the video material on your web-site.
Noam, do you mind me commenting that you come across a wee bit dour  you rather remind me of a lugubrious Calvinist Minister in fact?
The only mildly amusing story you have recounted since 1970 is the gently self-deprecatory one about your wife rushing to consult the doctor because she thought her ears were going - turned out her hearing was perfect - it was just that, you chuckled, her husband was an inaudible mumbler.
Professor, how would you like me to write your jokes for you?
I know  your asking yourself, is this bloke funny enough?
Will Scottish political humour work internationally?
Here is an ideological joke currently doing the rounds in Scotland:
A Scotswoman bursts into a carriage on a French train and urgently calls down the compartment, Is there a Catholic Priest on board?
No reply.

When it comes to public intellectuals if its a choice between you and Chomsky I would choose Chalmers Johnson every time. You are always informative and entertaining whereas Noam comes across a wee bit lugubrious.
Just watched a Google video entitled Decline of Empires and was tickled and astonished when, talking about Fox news, you declaimed direct to camera, of course it represents an Australian fascistI mean Rupert Murdoch the owner of News Corporation, owner of the Fox network. Crikey! Delivered deadpan but with the faintest shadow of an impish grin.
Chalmers, arent you concerned that some miscreant stoolpigeon will denounce you to the dirty digger (Murdochs eponym used by the British satirical magazine Private Eye)? He is famously humorless and litigious and you and your Russian Blue cat could end up in one of those naval brigs in South Carolina!

Dear Professor Johnson,
I was thrilled to receive the signed copy of your book, Nemesis  the Last Days of the American Republic, in this mornings post. And I very much admire the cover photo of you and Mof. 
What a strong intelligent face; those piercing eyes, exuding gravitas with a hint of intellectual disapproval; the haughty, insouciant demeanor of absolute self-confidence. 
Chalmers - you look quite nice too.
What an iconoclastic idea, to have a cover photo taken with your pussycat, on a pedagogic book of political science. I bet your editor was equivocal about the idea. It could easily have come across as a wee bit eccentric. But happily the majestic bearing of Mof largely avoided the risk of outlandish oddity. 
I notice that the book retails for $26  please find enclosed another six bucks? Contrary to English propaganda we Scots are immune to peculation or parsimony! 
With best regards,

PS I hasten to add that I categorically deny ever calling Mr. Murdoch vindictive as you mischievously suggest. And it has been brought to my attention that he appeared in The Simpsons as himself and was portrayed as a violent plutocrat, therefore, ex post facto, he has a fine sense of self-deprecatory humor. And I am sure any litigation he has pursued was entirely justified.

Phew, I think thats my ass covered!

Dear Mr. Bain,
Thank you for your charming letter(s) and the inclusion of another $10. That really wasnt necessaryauthors do get knock-offs on copies of their own books. Im afraid we couldnt buy Mof some haddock because  being 15 this summer  hes on a special diet. So we thought we would send some more photos instead.
The one of my husband and me was on our Christmas card last year, because in 2007 we celebrated our fiftieth wedding anniversary (the inset shows what we looked like back in 1957). The photo of the two cats reading proof on our JPRI book, Okinawa: Cold War Island, dates from 1999 and feature Miti on the left and Mof on the right. Alas, Miti (Mofs brother) died of cancer in 2002. (They were named Miti and Mof after Japans Ministry of International Trade and Industry  the subject of my husbands book MITI and the Japanese Miracle, and Mof, the Ministry of Finance.) After Miti died we wanted to get another cat but our vet said that because Miti was the dominant personality, we needed to see how Mof adjusted to being in charge. As you can see, hes adjusted quite well. He particularly likes sitting on the ironing-board, but the table is also acceptable. 
Youre right that Metropolitans editor was not at first keen on having him on the dust-jacket of Nemesis, but the jacket designer is also a cat person and so we had a friend at court.
Finally, a recent photo of our visitor raccoons. You probably have raccoons in Charlotte as well. Do you feed them? Ours are hooked on cheap oatmeal cookies that I buy at the 99-cent store.

Dear Sheila (and Mof and Chal),
I was delighted to receive your letter and the lovely photos, which arrived safely yesterday. We do indeed have raccoons here, (in fact we spotted a fat one slumbering, high up, in a tree behind our house the other day) but they never come near the house because of our two beasts. (Photos enclosed)
The black and white one is Max. He is a nine year old, phlegmatic, border collie cross and he came with us from Scotland.

The black one is Gypsy. She is an American rescue dog owned by an Italian/French couple, so now, rather unpatriotically, only responds to commands in French. Since her Europeans take both US and French holidays she is almost permanently on vacation chez nous. 
Whereas Max is calm and friendly, Gypsy  like many Americans  is irrationally belligerent. She makes George W. Bush look like a pacifist. No other animal is safe and she is not above giving humans a nip if she doesnt get exactly what she wants.

Dear Mr Rumsfeld,
I have just read an extraordinary article about you on a website called Counterpunch.com. The piece is the most libellous, defamatory, hatchet job I have ever beheld. You will, of course, go to litigation. I have enclosed $20 towards your legal costs.
The article is entitled Secretary of Lies and was penned by one Mike Whitney. His first sentence is the stunning, Rumsfeld is a pathological liar. Then follows a litany of insult and ad hominem obloquy:
Nothing (Rumsfeld) says can be trusted.
When the photos showed up from Abu Ghraib, Rumsfeld feigned surprise. "A few bad apples", he moaned. Now we know he did everything except fit the prisoners with women's underwear.
Nice touch, eh?
Twisted bastard.
"We know where the weapons are, they're in the area around Tikrit".
What a joke; it's like a carnival huckster pitching snake-oil to farm boys; nothing but smoke and mirrors; nothing but intellectual flatulence.
Then quotes from military critics, like the following, are ripped out of context and presented as veritas:
"The decision to invade Iraq, was done with a casualness and swagger that are the special province of those who have never had to execute these missions, or bury the results." Lt. Gen. Gregory Newbold.
Donald, Mr Whitneys bile spews forth in a monstrous torrent for over 600 words. I look forward to seeing you sue the pants off this unpatriotic, slanderous scoundrel. 
If I can be of any other help to you please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear Mr. Trump,
Are you aware that a monstrous personal attack has been made on you in a new book called, The Broken American Man  and how to fix him by the TV personality Rabbi Shmuley Boteach?
On page 9 this asininely opinionated cleric writes,
By any measure but money, Trump is a failure. He failed at two marriages. As a shallow braggart who cannot stop promoting himself and as someone who cannot stop ogling young, pretty females, he fails at being a refined gentlemanWhat has made this man a guru who attracts tens of millions of students? Is it that he has class? Come on! A sense of personal honor, perhaps? Give me a break. Nobility of spirit, depth of purpose? Nope. Is it his hair, perhaps? I think not.
If the sanctimonious Rabbi had any class himself he would avoid the vulgar, undignified, ad hominem attacks on a persons coiffure. The shaggy-bearded and abundantly hirsute Boteach is no oil painting himself, of course. In the photo on the back of his book he looks like a shabby overstuffed sofa, which has exploded.
Donald, I am Scottish, can he say this in the US?
No doubt your lawyers are already all over this tasteless and despicable slander. I would consider it a personal honor if you would accept the enclosed $20 towards your legal costs.

Dear Rabbi Boteach,
Just devoured your exciting new book about soullessness and the heroism of the average American dad, The Broken American Man.
I especially enjoyed your rapier-like evisceration of that ridiculous fop, Donald Trump. [But, Shmuley, arent you concerned that some malfeasant will bring your fearless denunciation to his attention and that ruinous litigation will ensue?]
Rabbi, I enclose 20 bucks because I would like your advice. 
As you discuss on page 67 my teenage children have posters of half naked pop stars and steroid pumped sports personalities all over their walls and none of the real hero in their lives, i.e. me.
So I had some posters made up. One of me, one of you, and one each of John Bolton and Dick Cheney and put them up in the kids room.
Of course I expected the wails of protest from the kids but was astonished to find that my wife refuses to support me in this action. 
She declared that I was bonkers. I drew her attention to what you had written about fathers being heros and she said, This guy sounds like a religious nutcase. What qualifications, other than imbibing bronze-age morality from the Torah, has this moron got for counseling people about their marriages?
I informed her that you were reputedly the most famous Rabbi in America, had penned a best-seller called, Kosher Sex, been Michael Jacksons Rabbi for two years and had written a book with Uri Geller (the spoon-bending phenomenon). To which she retorted, And he calls Donald Trump a shallow braggart who cant stop promoting himself.
Shmuley, could you drop me a line in the SAE saying if you agree with my position on the posters and what I should do about my scold of a wife? Rabbi, is divorce from a disobedient wife ever acceptable?
Support Mr Bush and Mr Cheney
Sincerely

Hi Andy,
Thanks for your very interesting and humorously written letter. Look, we have to always parent as a team. Our wives opinions matter. So, if your wifes objecting to putting posters of political figures in the bedroom maybe its because she wants the children to have timeless heroes.
I would suggest that first you try to compromise with her and suggest to her that since Dick Cheney is the Vice President theres nothing wrong with having pictures of elected officials in the room, so that your children can aspire to perhaps a life of service. But let her balance it with posters of people whom she thinks are a good influence on your children.
As far as your wifes criticism of me, I take them in my stride Im not perfect and thats the way it is. I try my best, but I am quite proud that most of the advice that I give is from the eternal values contained in the Torah. Wishing you all the best. G-d Bless.

Washington, DC 20036-1464

Dear Professor Waller,
I read the piece in the New York Times on Saturday May 6 about our new strategy of ridiculing the enemy in Iraq. 
I visited your blog, Fourth World War and I was fascinated to learn that officers on the Joint Staff at the Pentagon, and others in Iraq, said your paper, Ridicule: An instrument in the war on terrorism inspired the recent release of the raw video of al-Zarqawi. The video, with Major General Rick Lynchs briefing, showed al-Zarqawi in American sneakers and bobbling an US-made machine gun.
The crux of your paper, after a careful reading, seems to be that ridiculing the enemy
1. raises morale at home
2. strips the adversary of his mystique and prestige
3. eliminates the enemys image of invincibility
What then do you make of the bizarre pantomime of last weeks White House Correspondents Dinner? It was bad enough Stephen Colbert ridiculing and lampooning President Bush to his face. But when the Commander in chief, himself - in the middle of a war - stands up with an impersonator and accepts that he is universally regarded as a nincompoop, I think we have lost the plot.
Doesnt Mr Bushs buffoonish antics lower morale at home; doesnt his moronic clowning strip him of mystique and prestige; doesnt his absurd malapropisms eliminate any image of invincibility? 
Professor, you obviously have some gravitas on these questions and some influence in the Department of Defence. Cant you take George W. Bush aside and tell him he projects the image of a Pickwickian nitwit.
Professor my question to you is this: Isnt the Presidents cretinism a gift to our enemies?
I have enclosed a stamped addressed envelope and $20 towards your costs.
Sincerely yours

Dear Professor Schweikart,
I have just completed my second reading of your excellent, alliteratively titled, book, Americas Victories  Why the US Wins Wars and Will Win the War on Terror. As Rush Limbaugh predicted on the blurb, I was mesmerized. 
After much hectoring, I persuaded my (quasi-liberal) wife to peruse the book.
Larry, the poor woman only got to page 16 before she rather  baulked at the following comments: -
It is common for Western analyststo misread the situation and claim that the Abu Graib scandal blew a gaping hole in the Bush administrations policy in Iraq[showing] American soldiers not as liberators but as tormentors, not as professionals but sadists getting cheap thrills. But in most Arabic Islamic societies, and certainly in those frequented by the loopiest of suicide bombers, women have no standingWhat do you think was the response among these types of men when they saw pictures of American women holding Iraqi terrorist prisoners by dog chains? To some, undoubtedly, anger. But to others, respect.
My good lady wife opined, Even this twisted nutjob, Schweikart, cant really believe the raving, outlandish, gibberish he has penned!
On the contrary, I indignantly replied, I am certain that Professor Schweikart stands by every syllable.
Larry, the upshot is that I have bet my dopey spouse $40 that you continue to believe that sadistic treatment of detainees in primitive societies can often be efficacious.
I enclose $20, which is your share of our winnings, and a SAE so that you can drop me a line confirming that you still endorse firm treatment of prisoners of war.
Support Mr Cheney and Mr Bush
Sincerely yours,
Andy Bain
*************
Professor Schweikart replied:
Dear Andy,
You (and I) are right and your wife wrong, though Im sure shell never admit it. Thanks for my share of the winnings. One good deed deserves another: I have sent you a copy of my novel, September Day, a 9/11 thriller featuring (naturally) a professor as one of the heros (sic).
Coincidentally, this book retails at$20.
The comment, if your wife will bother to look, is supported by extensive documentation, not only from actual people in the field, but from Arab experts on Arab behavior (and note, I qualify that it only applies to shame/honor societies such as Bedouin Arab, and not necessarily Persian or, say, non-Arab Muslims who are not immersed in shame/honor codes. Again, though, the endnotes will show that many psychologists who study Arab/Bedouin behavior agree that the respect that is generated by such activities as the humiliation of Arab men is quite valuable for us.
Moreover, if you speak to our soldiers, most of them will tell you that if not for the rules of engagement, they would adopt more of these types of measures. In our war with Filipino insurrectos and the Muslim Moros in the Philippines from 1899-1912, our generals let it be known that all our bullets were coated in pig fat, and that any insurrecto bodies that were recovered would be buried with a pig. That had a chilling effect on the insurrection, which we won.
Enjoy September Day, and the paperback edition of Americas Victories, with much new material (including research on the numbers of enemies weve killed  which no one mentions) will be out in May.

Dear Mr Rumsfeld,
Are you aware that, on the 20th April, the well-known anarchist Noam Chomsky addressed the 500 Cadets of the Class of 2008 at West Point and that a video of the pantomime is now ubiquitous on the Internet? 
Donald, what kind of lunatic would invite the worlds most prominent, articulate and incisive opponent of the Iraq war to lecture to 500 intellectually defenseless cadets? Answer: Professor Robert Tully, who teaches philosophy there!
Using the cover of nave questions from the gullible teenage soldiers, Chomsky maligned you and denounced the war in Iraq as criminal aggression while our juvenile warriors sat dumbstruck.
He said, Ronald Reagan dropped Iraq from the list of states supporting terrorism in 1982 so that the US could start providing (Saddam) with extensive aid; including military aid; including means to develop biological and chemical weapons and missiles and nuclear weaponsand Donald Rumsfeld, shortly after went to (Baghdad to) firm up the agreement.
Speaking about the massacres in Hilabja, where Saddam gassed thousands of Kurds, Chomsky said, the US didnt objectin fact the Reagan administration blocked efforts in Congress even to protest against it. Furthermore the (US) support for Saddam increased and continuedright through the worst atrocities.
At this point the feckless Professor Tully staggered on to the stage and abruptly brought the unpatriotic fiasco to an end by bodily dragging Chomsky away from the microphone.
Secretary of Defense, what kind of idiot would tolerate West Point inviting the main opponent of our war to incite mutiny among the next cohort of our junior officers? Surely either you or the head of the US Military Academy must go?
I await your reply.

Dear Professor Tully,
Can I commend your iconoclastic decision to invite Professor Noam Chomsky to address the Cadet Class of 2008 on the Theory of Just War?
On watching the video, I sensed that the teenage soldiers were slightly shell-shocked as Chomsky described our 40 year terrorist campaign against Cuba; denounced Reagan and Rumsfeld as tacit supporters of Saddams atrocities and active suppliers of military aid to his diabolical regime, including means to develop biological and chemical weapons and missiles; characterised the Iraq war as a criminal aggression and ridiculed the idea of preventive war.
With no WMD being found in Iraq, the 9/11 Commission finding no links between Saddam and al Qaeda and the rather undemocratic activities of our troops in places like Haditha it was heroic of West Point to allow the most articulate opponent of the war to demolish the last remnants of the notion that this war was, in any degree, just.
That you and your colleagues at West Point still strive to form these innocent young people as warriors, knowing that the carnage and slaughter in the futile quagmire that is Iraq is a criminal aggression, makes one proud to be an American.
Support the President

Washington, DC, 20036

Dear Ambassador Bolton,
I have just laid down your scintillating and beautifully written new book, Surrender Is Not An Option. Bravo!
One paragraph has haunted me since I read it in the first chapter. Talking about joining the Maryland National Guard you wrote, 
I had concluded that the Vietnam War was lost, and I made the cold calculation that I wasnt going to waste time on a futile struggle. Dying for your country was one thing, but dying to gain territory that antiwar forces in Congress would simply return to the enemy seemed ludicrous to me. Looking back, I am not terribly proud of this calculation
John, you have nothing with which to reproach yourself. Who could express disapproval of any young person who said, as you famously did, "I confess I had no desire to die in a Southeast Asian rice paddy.
When I told my daughter, who also read your book, that I intended to write to you in the above terms she said, Yes but the hypocrisy would be if Bolton continued to support the war after he dodged the draft. He was a thrusting and ambitious young conservative and it is inconceivable that he would have spoken out against the war in Republican circles in 1970, five years before the war ended.
John, I admit, those comments led to a protracted and lively dispute between my daughter and I. 
The upshot is that I have bet my daughter $40 that you did not continue to support the war after joining the National Guard and did not support sending any more young men to be cannon fodder.
Ambassador, could you drop me a line in the SAE saying what your attitude was at that time so that I can collect my winnings? I enclose $20 as your share!
Support Mr Cheney and Mr Bush

Namely, The commonsense test the senators mother would apply when sizing up a persons characterIs this someone you would like to have at your kitchen table?
John, the whole of chapter 13 it is a crude hatchet job. You are described as, sour, mean-spirited, vindictive, a quintessentially kiss-up, kick down sort of guy and the most undiplomatic manin Washington!
On page 149 the Ex-Senator reports, without comment, the puerile epithets of the North Koreans who called you, rude human scum and a beastly man bereft of reason.

I know that you were, like many of us, hoodwinked into supporting the war in Iraq by General Colin Powells Machiavellian performance at the UN. Most intelligent people werent taken in and one certainly feels like a gullible simpleton now. 
But you have repeatedly toured in the Middle East to entertain our troops, so I assume that you still wish to avoid another Vietnam style debacle in Iraq.
Al, could I draw your attention to a paper by Professor J. Michael Waller entitled, Ridicule: An instrument in the war on terrorism. This paper inspired the recent briefing by Major General Rick Lynch on the raw video of al- Zarqawi wearing New Balance tennis shoes and bobbling an US made machine gun. 
The unanswerable conclusions of Professor Wallers piece are that ridicule of an enemy: 
a) raises morale at home
b) strips the adversary of his mystique and prestige
c) eliminates the enemys image of invincibility
You will have seen Stephen Colberts ribald insults to the Presidents face at the White House Correspondents Dinner. More bizarrely George W. Bush, himself - in the middle of a war - stood up with an impersonator and accepted that he is universally regarded as an imbecile.
As I watched this surreal pantomime I just knew they would be showing it, repeatedly, on al-Arabiya and al-Jazeera.
Al, as the American, other than George W. Bush, who has almost single-handed undermined our political leadership by ridicule and mockery arent you lowering morale at home; stripping our leaders of their mystique and eliminating our image of invincibility?

Dear Kathy Kostohryz,
Thank you for your Memorandum of the 23rd May 2006 and the return of $20 I sent to Al. Very honest. Some would have simply trousered the cash.
I presume from the brusque, dismissive form of your reply that you did not even show Al my epistle. Quite right!
It turns out Professor J. Michael Waller is a paid up nutty neo-con and has collaborated with Frank Gaffney Jr. on a new book call, War Footing. The book is the fevered ravings of delusional minds. Perhaps Al could have Mr Gaffney, who still insists there was WMD and collusion between Saddam and bin Laden, on the show?
As I said in my previous letter I, like Al, (but unlike most intelligent, informed people) swallowed the monstrous lies of General Colin Powell at the UN, line, hook and sinker. I have recently discovered that Colin as a young Major was tasked to investigate allegations of a massacre around the time of My Lai in Vietnam and he reported back, In direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations between American soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent."
Both Al and I should have known this guy was a lulu! If only he and I had listened to Hans Blix.
Kathy, I know you cant accept money but surely Al can take a drink from a lukewarm fan? Anyway here is the same $20. Tell him to stick it in his pocket  no questions asked.

Dear Tom,
Thank you for your astonishingly tardy reply (post marked 08 Dec 2006) to my letter and the return of my $20. (I confess after seven months I assumed you were going to trouser the cash in the despicable Scottish manner.) Your brusque and hastily scribbled note on the back of my SAE was much appreciated.
Tom, I wonder if you are aware that Chomsky has been at it again? In his latest book, Perilous Power  The Middle East and US Foreign Policy he says, on page 87,
the New York Timeshave a position, chief diplomatic correspondent, which is a euphemism for State Department representative, which was Thomas Friedman at the time (1991)He said the best of all worlds for the United States would be an iron fisted military junta ruling Iraq much the way Saddam Hussein did, but not him, because he is an embarrassment. And if we cant get that we have to have the second best, namely Saddam Hussein.
Tom, the bounder is saying you are a stooge of the State Dept. and an amoral hypocrite to boot. He is implying that all your persiflage about democracy is pure cant. Naturally I did not believe the above quotation for a moment. So I went on to the NYTs archive and was flabbergasted to find you writing,
The same iron fist that Saddam Hussein used to smash Kuwait he used to hold his centrifugal republic together. If the United States hopes to withdraw its troops from the gulf, and preserve all of its military gains from the war, it is essential that Mr. Hussein, or, preferably, a different but equally strong figure, is at the helm in Baghdad.   (17 march 1991)
Tom, I would appreciate your guidance on this because prima facie it would appear to the uninitiated that Chomsky is correct and you are, indeed, a cynical charlatan only paying lip service to ideas of democracy.
Looking forward to being set straight by you.
Sincerely yours,
Andy Bain
PS. Tom, are you aware that the liberal loony websites on the Internet have begun jocularly referring to a six-month period as, a Friedman Unit. They are referring to your practice, since 2003, as the tsunami of torture, slaughter and blood in Iraq has roared, of persistently arguing that the next six months are crucial. The trouble is you seem to have defended this position every three months since the criminal aggression started.

Dear Lauren F. Winner,
I have just read your difficult, disturbing but inspiring piece on teenage chastity in this mornings New York Times. Your brutally candid assertion that, many Christians still struggle withpremarital sex, adultery and pornography perceptively recognises that many professed believers are in fact duplicitous fornicators. Who can forget TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggartt (or indeed his Assemblies of God colleague Jim Bakker)?
However, I am troubled by your declaration that, the church is a place where you can lay bare your brokenness and sin. 
Lauren, do we really want teenagers laying bare their salacious, libidinous tales of rampant premarital sex in front of the elderly and the bashful?
Do you encourage teenagers to make these kind of prurient confessions in the doubtful atmosphere of Mormon or even Seventh Day Adventist temples? (Surely it is wildly irresponsible to direct a vulnerable teenager with tales of lecherous athletics to a Catholic priest?)
Finally, you aver, we pledge to speak Gods forgiveness to you if you falter. Doesnt this amount to (to use a British expression) selling the jerseys? i.e. giving the teenager absolution for any torrid sexual activity in advance?
Doesnt this amount to promotion of sexual permissiveness? Are there to be no sanctions for underage fellatio and cunnilingus except a priori condonation? (I apologise for my rough frankness (and for using three Latin terms in one sentence.)
Lauren, have I understood you properly? I enclose a stamped addressed envelope to facilitate a reply and $20 towards your campaign for, lifelong celibacy.

Dear Ms. Rehm,
I have been a devoted fan of your eclectic show since I moved to the US a year ago. Unfortunately, I can honestly report that, although I often agree with your guests, I have seldom concurred with a single utterance from you. Im afraid I find you to be a typical, dopey Washington liberal.
So it is with some surprise that I must report that the show of the 22nd Dec 2006 was by far the acme of the whole year.
Discussing the unfortunate events at Abu Ghraib (Mass Torture) and Haditha (Extra Legal Executions of innocent women and children) your NPR colleague Tom Gjelten correctly averred,  our adversaries are adept at manipulating and using propaganda against usthe challenge is...dealing with these propaganda operations.
Absolutely spot on, accurate and indisputable.
However, knowing your bleeding heart, wishy-washy, flaccid political opinions I fully expected you to leap in with one of your habitual gripes, e.g. Hang on a minute, are you seriously suggesting that the victims at Abu Ghraib and Haditha were letting themselves be sadistically tortured, sexually humiliated and wantonly slaughtered simply to embarrass the USA!?!
Diane, breathtakingly, you managed to hold your tongue and your listeners got the unalloyed, patriotic message that the perfidious Iraqis will stop at nothing to paint the US forces as cruel and pitiless imperialist storm troopers. Well done.
In the circumstances please find enclosed $20. Have a drink on me. (On no account donate the cash to NPR as I abhor the notion of public funded radio  clearly a communist idea  Diane, this gift is for you personally.)
Support Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney
God Bless America

Dear Dr. Kissinger,
I am reading an unpleasant book by the ex-New York Times hack Stephen Kinzer, whom I am sure you know, called Overthrow - Americas Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq.
On page 180, talking about Chile, Kinzer quotes you as saying, I dont see why we need to stand by and watch a country go Communist due to the irresponsibility of its own people.
Henry, did you actually ever say this? 
Kinzer gives no source but I have noted that this deplorable quote is reproduced ubiquitously on the web and in books. Wikipedia, as well as the above, also quotes you as saying, the issues are much too important for the Chilean voters to be left to decide for themselves. Surprise, surprise, again no source is given.
Of course, the transparent motivation is to portray one of our most distinguished elder statesmen as a cynical, Machiavellian, anti-democratic, monster.
I intend to write to Mr Kinzer and challenge his gratuitous attempt to sully the reputation of one of Americas diplomatic heroes. Henry, could you drop me a line confirming that you deny ever uttering such stupid and buffoonish words?
Yours sincerely
Andy Bain

Dear Ambassador Bremer,
Just finished your tremendous My Year in Iraq. A tour de force which reads like a scintillating Le Carre novel. My congratulations to you.
One question if I may? On page 360 during a secret National Security Council (NSC) meeting discussing our selection of a Prime Minister for the Iraqis you report President Bush as declaring, Weve got to be certain the new PM wont ask us to leave the day after sovereignty.
Jerry, doesnt this let the cat out of the bag? 
First, it reveals that we understand that all the persiflage on the Iraqis being ecstatic about being liberated by us is just propaganda for the consumption of the gullible US domestic population.
Second, the clear implication is that we want to remain in Iraq to control the oil.
And third we were in a funk because if asked to leave we would have to abandon all the verbiage about democracy and rule Iraq with an iron fist in the face of universal condemnation and obloquy.
Jerry, in retrospect, was it wise to reveal our real-politik in your book?
I would love to have your thoughts and to that end I have enclosed $20 towards your cost of reply. I would love a signed photo if you have one. 
Support President Bush 
Sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. Bain
Thank you for you nice note. I am glad you enjoyed the book. It tries to portray what was a very trying time in a way the reader can understand. And it seems to have worked for you.
As for the comment by the President you cite, this strikes me as a perfectly understandable reaction to having to deal with personalities he did not know and a situation which, at the time of this meeting was very fluid. We knew that once the occupation was over, the Iraqi government would be perfectly free to ask us to leave. We knew at that time that an immediate departure would be very harmful, for Iraqis in particular. So the comment reflected reality.
The idea that we want to control Iraqi oil is simply wrong. I was in literally hundreds of hours of meetings with people from all levels of our government over a period of 15 months. I never once heard anyone make any comment about controlling the oil. And when I repealed Saddams restriction against foreign direct investment in Iraq, I intentionally (and publicly) excluded the entire oil industry.
Thank you, too, for sending along $20, which I return herewith. I am afraid I dont have any publicity photos. If you find one on the net which you like, you can always print it out and send it to me for signing.
Sincerely

Dear Ambassador Bremer,
I just returned from a months vacation in France (still full of, cheese-eating surrender monkeys Im afraid, and all declaring that Chirac was right all along on Iraq) and was very pleased to find your reply to my letter of 5th June. 
I enclose a photo of you from the net, which you kindly offered to sign for me. I choose one that features the famous desert boots (and the boss).
Apropos the question of us coveting Iraqi oil - obviously, I realise that in your position you must deny that we are drooling over the trillions of dollars involved. 
But doesnt the fact that we swiftly secured the Ministry of Oil in Baghdad, with plentiful squads of main-battle tanks and hordes of hairy-assed marines, while the irreplaceable treasures of antiquity were being looted from the citys museums tell an objective observer all he needs to know about our priorities?
Jerry, if Iraqs main export was turnips would you have been the head of a Coalition Provisional Authority?

Miami, FL 3172

Dear General Craddock,
Just came across this fascinating snippet from the New York Times of 03 Oct. 2006. 
On Sunday, President (Hugo) Chvez (of Venezuela) said he had received warnings that the United States might be plotting to assassinate him. General Craddock responded: ''That's mindless. That's far out. It's way over the top.''  
Bantz, both you and I know (as men of the world) that we have a salubrious history of eliminating, with extreme prejudice, our perceived foes. I believe our CIA guys jocularly refer to it as, suicide involuntarily administeredby the Agencys Health Alteration Committee!
Personally, I have always appreciated our dazzling brio in concocting brilliant and daring plots to eliminate political miscreants. I particularly enjoyed our attempt to assassinate Patrice Lumumba, the first democratically elected Prime Minister of the Congo, by poisoning a tube of his toothpaste. 
I am also a great admirer of our numerous attempts to bump off Fidel Castro. Poison fountain pens, poisoning his cigars with botulinum bacillus and spraying his TV studio with LSD are just some of the ingenious attempts we have made on his life. Lacing the crotch of his wetsuit with thallium salts to make his hair fall out and thus render him ridiculous was also inspired.
The exploding conch shell and JFKs use of the Mafia to simply pump Castro full of lead, I am not so keen on. No class, I am sure you will agree, General. 
As the US Senate Church Committee observed, The proposed assassination devices ran the gamut from high-powered rifles to poison pills, poison pens, deadly bacterial powders and other devices which strain the imagination.
So, I certainly hope that it is not only the Russians who are experimenting with Plutonium 210 as an aid to efficient espionage.
Bantz, although you obviously must maintain plausible deniability I think most Americans understand that in the rough world of realpolitik it is sometimes necessary to take the gloves off. 
General, please find enclosed $20 towards dealing with Chavez!

Dear Dr. Kagan,
This morning I had the great pleasure of perusing, in the Weekly Standard, your rousing article, How We'll Know When We've Won - A definition of success in Iraq.
It cheered me up to realize that we have such a percipient military analyst ruminating about this perplexing question.
Later, perhaps unwisely, I persuaded my daughter to read your piece.
She launched into a hysterical rant, shouting, How will this moron know when we have lost? After six years there are a million Iraqis dead, four million displaced refugees, over four thousand U.S. soldiers dead and thirty thousand wounded.  The Green Zone is taking incoming mortar fire almost every day and it is still lethal to try to drive to the airport. Iraq is a hell disaster and the vast majority of Americans dont support the war and want the troops to come home.
How much worse will it have to get before chicken- hawk cretins like Kagan finally get it? How many more young soldiers is he willing to feed into the meat grinder? Will two million dead Iraqis be enough for this armchair warrior to admit that we may not be winning?
Frederick, this verbal torrent has somewhat discombobulated me. How will we know when we have lost? 
This question has been troubling me all day.
Could you drop me a line in the enclosed SAE saying at what point you would be prepared to throw in the towel and accept defeat? I have enclosed $20 towards your costs.
Thanking you in advance.

Just read your new book, Fire-Breathing Liberal  How I Learned To Survive (And Thrive) In The Contact Sport Of Congress and had to drop you a line to say, bravo! 
Like most people I only knew you as that crazy guy who went on The Colbert Report and was hoodwinked into uttering the preposterous line, I enjoy cocaine because it is a fun thing to do and then the even more wildly inappropriate, I enjoy the company of prostitutes because its a fun thing to doIf you combine the two together, its probably even more fun.
Congressman, the nation found your shenanigans buttock-clenchingly embarrassing but at least you did not suffer the humiliating fate of Georgia Republican (and religious nut) Lynn Westmoreland who had sponsored a bill requiring the display of the Ten Commandments in both the House and Senate but when asked by Colbert to, Name the Ten Commandments the moron could come up with only three!!
One tiny criticism? On page 138 you draw attention to, Republican congressman Randy Duke Cunningham [who] went to jail for accepting millions of dollars in bribes and Democratic congressman William Jefferson of Louisiana [who] was indicted after ninety thousand dollars in cash was found in his freezer.  
Robert, is it wise to even mention these scandals? We already know about Florida Republican congressman Mark Foley sending sexually explicit text messages to underage congressional pages; homophobic Republican Senator Larry Craig busted for soliciting a cop in a public toilet; David Vitter a client of the "D.C.

Dear Mr Hadley,
Has anyone drawn your attention to the scurrilous lies laid against you in James Bamfords disgraceful book, Pretext for War?
On page 370 Bamford relates how in Colin Powells preparation for his presentation to the UN Security Council the Secretary of State insisted that, the discredited connections between Saddam Hussein and the 9/11 attacks, and meetings between hijacker Mohamed Atta and an Iraqi intelligence official in Prague, Czech Republic be cut.  the Secretary actually threw the paper down on the table and said, Im not saying that.  
Bamfords next paragraph is the real poison, he writes:
Even after Powell threw material out, it would occasionally be quietly put back in. one of the most outrageous ones was the Mohamed Atta meeting in PragueSteve Hadley on one occasion [put] it back inthe Secretary said, 
I thought I cut this? 
And Hadley looked around and said, My fault, Mr Secretary, I put it back in. 
Well, cut it permanently! yelled Powell.
Stephen, I am sure you appreciate how damaging this is. Bamford portrays you as a sneaky, manipulative, dishonest scoundrel.
As a lawyer I am certain you will sue. I enclose $20 towards your legal costs. (A modest contribution - I wish I could send you more but I am currently unemployed)

Dear Admiral Hutson,
I watched your informative appearance of CNNs Situation Room yesterday with Wolf Blitzer discussing the massacre in Haditha. 
I was watching with my daughter. When you declared that if any marines were found guilty they would be punished, or even executed She fired her soda violently up through her nose and guffawed uproariously for ten minutes.
She is only twenty and is totally ignorant of our countrys great history and record in punishing the crimes committed by our soldiers. I told her that after the My Lai massacre in Vietnam where between 347 - 504 unarmed men, women and children had been slaughtered, some tortured and raped, by US soldiers we executed plenty of the Butchers Brigade.
My daughter demanded chapter and verse. So I did a little research on Google and was flabbergasted to find that only Lieutenant Calley was convicted and he only  served three and a half years of house arrest. I could find no other incident of US soldiers being executed for killing civilians but, I told my daughter, I am certain a former military prosecutor wouldnt have gone on CNN and given the impression that execution is a possibility if there had never been a previous case.
My daughter says, I am a poor dupe to believe any US soldier has or ever will be executed for slaughtering gooks or ragheads.
Admiral, were you only suggesting a hypothetical outcome or have we ever actually punished murderous malfeasance by our troops? 
I enclose a stamped addressed envelope. Hope you can put me straight.
Sincerely yours,
Andy Bain
***********
Admiral Hutsons Reply (Scribbled on my original letter):

I was speaking hypothetically. It is a capital offense and execution is authorized. As a practical matter, Id be surprised if in this day and age execution would actually be approved. Historically, we have seldom executed military personnel - none since war II

Dear Mr. Sagal,
Can I commend your boisterously witty program Wait, Wait specifically this weeks superlative edition. I listened on National Public Radio (NPR) while driving with my sister. I laughed so hard at the opening panel round that I think I have pulled something in my groin! It went like this:
US interrogators have been using pop music by Eminem and Neil Diamond to torture prisoners at Guantanamo Bay (Laughter) It appears that the US may have engaged in illegal activities at GITMO and violated international laws because they didnt do what?
Take requests (loud Laughter) this is going out to Ahmed from the boys in cell block fiveSeasons in the Sun by Terry Jack (sustained Laughter) 
Female voice singing and breaking up in mirth, We had Joy, we had sun (prolonged demonic cackling).
Hint: They might be violating code II of the ASCAP Convention
They didnt pay royalties to the guys whose songs they used
Right (hysterical Laughter)
For the past few years the interrogators at GITMO have been playing pop songs on an endless loop to get the inmates to crack but if youre going to blindfold and tie-up prisoners in confined spaces without legal representation and force them to listen to Celine Dion on endless loops you better make sure youre not violating the part of the Geneva Convention which protects Celine Dions basic royalty rights (moronic tittering)
Same female voice The worst part is if they dont pay, Celine Dion is gonna go down there and play LIVE!! (extended uncontrolled laughter)
My sister had pulled the car over and was sitting with her head on the steering wheel. She groaned, Has our country descended, so quickly, to this, that a bunch unspeakable fkwits on NPR can chortle and snigger about the fact that we are wantonly torturing human beings in US gulags?
My sister is a bleeding heart pinko with zero sense of humor. The fact that the prisoners are handcuffed in stress positions for hours with bags over their heads only makes it funnier in my opinion. 
My sister usually donates to NPR every time you have a fund drive but I think you can whistle for her contributions from now on. In the circumstances please find enclosed $20, from me, towards your hilarious endeavors.

Dear Richard,
I recently borrowed, from my library, the inspiring book you co-authored with David Frum, An End to Evil  How to win the war on Terror.
After devouring the book I looked up some of the reviews that appeared when it was published.
I was horrified to read the hatchet job in the New York Times by one Michiko Kakutani. He wrote:
[The title] captures the authors' absolutist, Manichaean language and worldview; their cocky know-it-all tone; their swaggering insinuation that they know ''how to win the war on terror'' and that readers, the Bush administration and the rest of the world had better listen to them.
Making its points with all the subtlety of a pit bull on steroids, ''An End to Evil'' is smug, shrill and deliberately provocative.
"points tend to be drowned out by their triumphalist boasts their macho posturing and their willful, flame-throwing language.
Such contradictions, combined with the volume's bullying tone and often specious reasoning, make for a strident, sophistical book, one unlikely to persuade anyone who doesn't already share the authors' super-hawkish views and self-righteous braggadocio.
Richard, did you sue this Kakutani guy? Did you protest to the NYTs?

In the interview, Perle described the war in Iraq as certain to be a quick war by any standards and asserted that we will find weapons of mass destruction when the people who know where they are are free to talk to us

Dear Mr Koppel,
I have just come across your perspicacious article in the New York Times advocating the use of mercenaries. 
You make many eminently sensible points on the, seductive notion of a mercenary army, the question of the astronomical costs of our military and the, growing disenchantment with the war in Iraq.
Ted, could I ask about some flaws I think I have identified in your reasoning?
Robert Kaplan, in his magisterial book, Imperial Grunts (Robert was at Camp David yesterday advising Mr Bush about Iraq, I see) on page 60 says, It is not rare for non-commissioned officers [in the US army] to be on food stamps - i.e. our troops are so poorly paid that mercenaries who demand a living wage can never compete for price with our patriotic grunts.
What ever happened to cheap and efficient American use of local death squads? Isnt the School of the Americas still economically pumping out pitiless murderers and depraved torturers? Can they no longer assassinate Archbishops? Are they now incapable of raping Nuns?
We have nearly a thousand military bases all over the world. Wouldnt the great US public start to question our ubiquitous deployment if they were also asked to shell out for private killers?

Dear Professor Ferguson,
As a fellow Scot, I have long been an admirer of your erudition and journalism. 
Your article in the LA Times yesterday caused a major stushie in our house. You wrote that, Pinochet was a sonofabitch[but]Allende's Servicio de Investigaciones was certainly not above using torture.
At breakfast, I drew your article to the attention of my daughter who is studying Latin American politics at University. She went berserk. She screamed, This wanker (Im afraid she is rather prone to the Scottish demotic) Ferguson is a disgusting apologist for killers and torturers. He tries to exculpate Pinochet by smearing Allende.
Pinochets monsters actually did strap women to the parillada (barbeque  a metal table) and insert electrodes in their vaginas and mercilessly electrocuted them, as happened to Dr Sheila Cassidy, the British surgeon. But Ferguson claims that Allende might have stooped to similar depravities. What a sonofabitch! 
I told my daughter that it was highly unlikely that the Laurence Tisch Professor of History, and a Scottish gentleman, would waffle like a moron in a great, national newspaper if he could not back up his claim with rock solid evidence. She bet me $40 that I couldnt come up with any credible sources to corroborate your claim.
Niall, I have done some research on the net and at our excellent public library but am having extreme difficulty uncovering any information on the malfeasance of Allendes secret, military policemen.

Dear Colonel Hunt,
Just finished you latest, invigorating book, On The Hunt  How to Wake Up Washington and Win the War on Terror. It is elegantly written in a bracing, martial style, liberally laced with expletives and earthy phrases like everything [we] have tried has proven to be worth less than a bucket of warm piss. 
I particularly enjoyed your quip on page 52 when talking about Muqtada al-Sadr, viz. the fat bastard with a beard.
But, Colonel, it is your searing honesty, which most struck me. On page 39 I was genuinely stupefied to read, Hell, I admit that even I was wrong  totally, inexorably wrong. Numerous times on Fox News I said, They had WMDs by the ton in Iraq.
You are the only military pundit who has admitted that they have been on national TV spouting lethal gibberish. Well done.
However, the reason I felt compelled to write is because of comments you made in an interview with the National Review Online. Asked about women in combat you said, I dont care if I have a whole division of lesbians if they can do the job.
I consider myself as open-minded as the next man, David, but I cant follow you on this one. Frankly, the thought of 15,000 lesbians armed to the teeth makes me quake in my shoes.
Besides, wouldnt it be culturally insensitive to invade Islamic or macho Hispanic countries and kill their citizens with brigades of belligerent Sapphic soldiers?

Dear Senator Kerry,
Felt compelled to write and congratulate you on the marvelous passage of Senate Bill 2979  To exempt the African National Congress from treatment as a terrorist organization. The BBC reported, Former South African President Nelson Mandela is to be removed from a U.S. terrorism watch list under a bill President Bush signed Tuesday.
Senator, like many citizens, I was aghast to learn that Mandela, the Nobel Peace Prize winner in 1993, was on the terrorism watch list in 2008. I was equally flabbergasted to learn that the CIA tipped off the Apartheid regimes security police as to Mandela's whereabouts and disguise, which led to his arrest and incarceration for 27 years. When one recalls that the CIA also assisted Saddams rise to power, I think Senator that you will agree with me, that the CIA is a piece of work.
Of course, technically it wont make any difference since Mandela was always popping into the US to meet presidents, attend rock concerts and address the UN. Still, bills like this send a message and they keep the congress occupied between voting gazillions of dollars for the continuing slaughter in Iraq.
Well done, Senator. Keep up the good work!
Sincerely
Andy Bain
PS. John, could you slip the enclosed $20, for his legal costs, to Senator Ted Stevens the next time you encounter him on the floor? As you know he has been indicted on charges that he concealed hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts and services from a company in his home state, Alaska. We dont need any more Senators in the slammer. 
PPS. I would write to Ted myself but since I am already writing to you it seems profligate to waste another stamp.

Dear General Sanchez,
 Just finished your brilliant book, Wiser in Battle. One of the best, rip-roaring reads I have ever had. Bravo!
I particularly enjoyed your revealing anecdote that while all hell broke out everywhere in Iraq and the armys logistics flow was disrupted the juvenile republican placemen in the Green Zone complained, about not having the full complement of Brown and Root menus!! Later you recount that with, overall increased levels of violence, rumors surfaced that Baghdad was in chaos and the city was about to fall. Employees of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) seemed especially upset. Actually, I believe their panic never completely subsided from the moment that full cafeteria menus were cut off 
General, you make it abundantly clear that you considered Ambassador Bremer and his minions were four-letter fellows.
On the question of the unpleasantness at Abu Ghraib you make it plain that torture outside of the Geneva Conventions was un-American and unacceptable. We must always ensure our torture falls within the Geneva guidelines.
Ricardo, the reason I write is to support your brave words on page 453. You write, 
In September 2002 Vice President Cheney, Condoleezza rice, Donald Rumsfeld and other key officials announced that Iraq had long-standing ties to al-Qaeda and, by inference, was partly responsible for the 9/11 attacksIn his January 2003 State of the union address President Bush asserted that Saddam was in possession of the material to produce 500 tons of sarin, mustard [gas] and VX nerve agent more than 38,000 liters of botulinum toxinand upwards of 30,000 munitions capable of delivering chemical agentsHe also stated that Iraq had attempted to purchase high-strength aluminum tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production and had sought significant quantities of uranium from Africaa week later Colin Powell spoke before the UN security council, reasserted the link between al-Qeada  and Iraq, and presented satellite photos and illustrations that he said showed chemical weapons bunkers and mobile biological weapons factories.
None of it was true. 
It was all a web of lies. 
General, one question, if I may? 
I accept that Cheney, Rice and Rumsfeld must be exposed as amoral dissemblers but is it entirely ethical for you to reveal a brother officer, namely General Powell in front of a global TV audience of 2 billion, to be the biggest liar in history?
Once again congratulations on a wonderful book.

Dear Prime Minister,
Stumbled upon a snippet on the BBC website entitled, 10 Things That Make Blokes Cry. It reported, In his resignation speech last May, there was a watery shine in Tony Blairs eyes as he thanked the British people and said, My apologies to you for the times I have fallen short.
Tony, when I read that I choked up and found myself blubbering like a big girls blouse. Which is very strange as my wife says I am a frozen, dour, insensitive bastard.
The thought of a once boyish Prime Minister, reduced to a haggard, care-worn, balding, wreck, having to slink away despised by his party and the electorate had me dribbling like a giant soppy baby.
I think the last time I wept was when I saw the effects of White Phosphorus (WP) on people in Iraq. WP or Willy Pete, as it is termed by our grunts in the US army, is used to shake and bake the recalcitrant population in places like Fallujah. The injuries are really horrific. If humans are hit by pieces of white phosphorus, it can burn right down to the bone. And of course we are also using a modern form of napalm in Iraq too  mark 77, a gel made from kerosene and polystyrene.
However, enough of gloomy, tear-inducing thoughts.  Cheer-up, were not Iraqis!! Heres twenty bucks  have a drink on me. You look as if you could use a stiff one, Tony.
God Bless America

Bristol, PA 19007

Dear Congressman Murphy,
Just finished your autobiography, Taking the Hill  From Philly to Baghdad To the US Congress. What a cracking good read. You certainly packed a lot into your 34 years  Lawyer, West Point professor, Soldier, Congressman and now acclaimed Author - and such a sensible noggin on those young shoulders.
Was particularly struck by the moving story you recounted on page 5 when some paratroopers shot a twelve-year-old Iraqi child. You wrote,
The whole case left me with a profound unease. It reminded me of the words of Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir: that when peace finally comes, it will be easier to forgive our enemies for killing our sons and daughters than it will be to forgive them for making us kill theirs.
Patrick, when I read that sentence, I must admit, at first I thought, this guy must be a raving nutcase. The Iraqis made us kill their children?!? They made us invade their oil rich country and forced us to slaughter them by the hundreds of thousands!?! When did Iraqis threaten us or kill our sons and daughters?
But thinking about it I began to understand your viewpoint. If the Iraqis had simply accepted the invasion and occupation, the de-baathification, the scrapping of the army, a poltroon as Viceroy, the chaos, the looting, the lack of electricity and clean water, the arrogant, juvenile republicans in the Green Zone, the unemployment and the hunger then everything would have been OK. But like almost all backward, third world populations they behaved illogically and began an insurgency, which we responded to with unlimited savagery, which, of course only inflamed the rebellion which we ruthlessly tried to crush which ledwell we all know where it led.
Keep up the good work in Congress.
Sincerely
Andy Bain

Dear Mr. Zakaria,
Have just finished your excellent new book, The Post-American World and many of your prognostications are sound. 
So, I was astonished to read an interview you did with CNN, last Friday, where you declared, Musharraf was good for Pakistan and for America.
Prima facie this is bonkers. When I read that sentence I thought I had misjudged you and that rather than a sober international political analyst you were in fact a pathetic apologist for US militarism and a fraudulent half-wit. Especially as the Asian Development Bank describes Pakistan as a country with, "poor governance, endemic corruption and social indicators that are among the worst in Asia" And Musharraf and his Military Intelligence are widely considered to be in cahoots with the Taliban and bin-Laden is assumed to be their guest in the North West Frontier!!
Fareed, I was bamboozled. However, on reflection perhaps you are right. Given our inexplicable support for the decades long oppression of the Palestinians, the illegal invasion and slaughter in Iraq and the imminent carnage in Iran anything approaching democracy in the third world is bound to lead to violently anti-American governments.
In these circumstances backing repugnant dictators is our only logical option to deflect the indignation of ordinary people everywhere.

 Dear Mr. Giuliani,
Are you aware of the despicable attacks made on you by one Glenn Greenwald in his recently published book, Great American Hypocrites?
On Page153 Greenwald writes [Giuliani] obtained one deferment after the next  including one under highly questionable circumstances - to ensure that he did not have to fight for his country, instead sending other Americans off to die.
Quoting Salon he continues, Upon graduation from law school in 1968his draft status reverted to1-a, the designation awarded to those most qualified for induction into the armyGiuliani won a clerkship with federal judge Lloyd McMahonhe quickly applied for another deferment based on his judicial clerkship. This time the Selective Service System denied his claimthe desperate Giuliani prevailed upon his boss to write to the draft board, asking them to grant him a fresh deferment and reclassification as an essential civilian employee.
Greenwald then writes, The very idea that a law clerk for a federal judge  fresh out of law school  is essential in any way is absurd 
Rudy, next the real poison.
in September 2007, Giuliani published a lengthy article in Foreign Affairs and this Vietnam-era draft dodger had the audacity to cite Americas lack of resolve in finishing that war as a major cause of weakness
Rudy, Greenwald paints you as a pathetic chickenhawk who hid while real patriotic young men served and died.
No doubt you will sue this scoundrel. I would consider it a personal honor if you would accept the enclosed $20 towards your costs.

As to the subject of the address, we will be guided by Douglas advice but as you know he was the head of the Pentagons Policy organization prior to the Iraq War and was able to counter the unpatriotic timidity and misinformation peddled by the US intelligence community. Perhaps he could say a few words on that subject.
Our members will be receive the following leaflet:

Las Vegas, NV 89101

Dear Senator Reid, 
I am reading your marvelous new book, The Good Fight  Hard Lessons From Searchlight to Washington. Candidly, books by public servants can often be a wee bit desiccated and tedious so I approached your tome with some trepidation, especially given the unprepossessing, hangdog photo of you they inexplicably choose to use on the cover.
But not a bit of it - a roller coaster read from almost the first page. Bravo Harry!
I particularly enjoyed the anecdote of your trip, in 2004, to Bethesda naval hospital to visit wounded Marines. You wrote,
A soldierhad two badly injured legs. One leg was held in the air by a pulley contraption. The other was badly disfigured. We need to get you better-armored vehicles, I told him.
Fuck the new vehicles, he said. I was blown through the top of my Stryker. And look at me. We dont need new vehicles. We need to get out of Iraq. Now
That bluff, nave young man probably cannot comprehend the labyrinthine politics that have necessitated you and your Democratic colleagues continuing to vote for funding for the carnage right into 2008. He, like many, no doubt consider it political cowardice that motivates the Democrats, but Harry the troops must have the better armor even if they would just rather come home.
The other striking story you recount is your 2005 trip to Baghdad and the mendacious briefing you got from General David Petraeus. You wrote, [His] report was glowing. The training is going spectacularly well, he saidThis thing is in good shape. The Iraqi army is standing up.
But it did not take long for us to learn that what he told us was not actually the case at all. This tends to give one a jaundiced view of such reports going forward. 
Senator, beautifully put - understated but leaving no one in any doubt that you consider Generals to be a bunch of duplicitous bastards. Well done, Harry. A great book!
Keep up the good work
God Bless America

Andy Bain

Dear Mr. Scheuer,
I wrote to you back in April but did not receive the courtesy of a reply. Fair enough. You are a busy man. But never let it be said that Andy Bain bears a grudge. Heres another twenty bucks - have a drink on me!
Michael, I have been rereading your hefty tome, Marching Toward Hell and on page 257, discussing the porosity of our borders you trenchantly write, 
an effective network of fences, trenches, watch towers, radars and  if necessary  minefields can be built in a crash program along the Canadian and Mexico borders.
I, and I am sure Lou Dobbs the obese CNN ideologue, have no problem with minefields on the Mexican border. I am even willing to contemplate missile-armed drones, cluster bombs and White Phosphorus to deal with Hispanics (except Cubans, obviously) on our southern border.
But, for Christs sake Michael, many Canadians are White Anglo-Saxon Protestants. I know you are of the Roman persuasion and so are fully justified in taking a profligate attitude to Latin Americans. But are you seriously relaxed about the inevitable international incidents that will occur when hordes of inebriated Canucks stagger into our 5,525 mile Maginot Line and are blown to smithereens?
We are not talking about Iraqis you know! Get a grip man.

Are you aware of the outrageous ad hominem attack on you in Senator Harry Reids recent book, The Good Fight  Hard Lessons From Searchlight to Washington?
Apropos a briefing you gave during his 2005 trip to Baghdad Reid writes, [Petraeus] report was glowing. The training is going spectacularly well, he saidThis thing is in good shape. The Iraqi army is standing up.
But it did not take long for us to learn that what he told us was not actually the case at all. This tends to give one a jaundiced view of such reports going forward. 
General, I am sure you appreciate the full gravity of this understated, yet poisonous attack.
Harry Reid is accusing our greatest warrior of being a bloviating, duplicitous, slippery customer. [Unfortunately, the continuing farcical military prowess of the Iraqi Army tends to lend gravitas to the Majority Leaders glum analysis.]
Being sure you will sue this gross libel I enclosed $20, which I hope you will accept towards your legal costs.
David, as I am sure you are aware Senator Reid is a bear of very little brain. Of course we want 4-star Generals who are cunning i.e. ingenious and who are slippery i.e. unpredictable. Predictable dullards are what got us into this shambles in Iraqi e.g. Generals Powell, Myers, Pace, Casey, Sanchez and Franks, [I exclude General Abizaid from this list as I understand, like you, he isnt as dopey as he looks.]

Can I commend your refreshing article in todays Washington Post on the subject of politically motivated verbal violence? As a life-long conservative Im pleased to find myself in full agreement with President George W. Bushs chief speechwriter!
Who could fail to be revolted by WAPO blogger David Weigal writing, when Rush Limbaugh went to hospital with chest pains, I hope he fails and Matt Drudge is a shut-in who should set himself on fire.
 Or Mike Malloy saying Glenn Beck should do the honorable thing and blow his brains out. This Malloy will look awfully silly when the clearly unstable Beck does pull an Ernest Hemingway.
Imagine my shock then, when I showed my son, who is studying journalism, your article and he went berserk shouting, 
When this buffoon Gerson was writing fiction for Dubya he came up with Axis of Evil and the smoking gun, coming in the form of a mushroom cloud that led to real, as opposed to verbal, violence. That led to one million dead Iraqis and torture and sexual humiliation of prisoners at Abu Ghraib. And now this effete, religious nutjob wants to lecture us on political rudeness!?! He makes me want to barf in a bucket!

She took your piece to her room to read. Later I enquired what she thought of it. I was bamboozled when she replied: -
Dad, theres something fishy about it!
When Mrs. Robinson set our project on Democracy around the World she made a big thing of using reputable sourcesso Laura (Beckys BFF) and I used, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the UN Human Rights Councilthis journalist only uses one source  something called Freedom House I just looked it up on Wikipedia and they admit they are 66% funded by the US government and in 2005 the Chairman was James Woolsey the former Director of the CIA so there might be some clandestine funding too!
I said, I hardly think Mr. Hiatt, a Senior American journalist, would waffle like a moron in a national newspaper unless his sources were unimpeach
She laughed derisively, Dad, this article is just regurgitated propaganda from the government!

Dear Fred,
Delighted to receive your charming reply in this mornings post. 
You seem to accept that Freedom House is indeed a clumsy front for US state propaganda but when they pump out any old horse manure a patriot must just gullibly swallow it.
The US government happily supports blood-drenched torture dictatorships like Egypt, Iran under the Shah, Saudi Arabia, Argentina under the generals, Chile under Pinochet, Greece under the generals, Uzbekistan, Indonesia while it committed genocide in East Timor and the 40 year occupation of Palestine? 
It illegally attacks other nations i.e. Iraq, Nicaragua, Grenada, Panama, Cambodia, Laos, Cuba (and Iran soon). 
It has overthrown elected democracies in 
Iran (Mossadegh 1953), 
Guatemala (Arbenz 1953), 
Ecuador (Velasco 1960), 
Congo (Lumumba 1960),  
Brazil (Goulart 1964),

Ghana (Nkrumah 1966),
Chile (Allende 1973),
Greece (Papandreou 1967), 
Bolivia (Paz 1964)
Venezuela (Chavez 2002) Coup initially successful but failed.
And of course the reason the Vietnamese elections in 1955 were cancelled was because the US knew that the wrong people would win. The US preferred to kill 3 million people rather than allow democratic elections.
Only an indolent ignoramus posing as a journalist would take anything from the US government on Democracy as anything but an outlandish joke!

Dear Ms. Clinton,
Are you aware of the bizarre activities of the State Department-funded outfit Freedom House? 
Their website has a world map showing which countries they consider Free, Partly Free or Not Free. Astonishingly, these lunatics have both Iraq and Afghanistan listed as Not Free!!
Have these cretins not seen the purple fingers denoting who has voted; dont they know that the Iraqis, after new elections, have been forming a new government for the last five months; dont they know that President Karzai was recently re-elected in a landslide?
Now, I am not some nave, mindless redneck, I know these are not perfect countries. I am aware that we had a problem with General Ray Odierno in Iraq throwing himself around like a homicidal bull in a China shop but I am told he now gets it. I know we have had problems in Afghanistan with corruption and General McCrystals wildly unbalanced behavior and the outright maniacs he employed.
Even so, you would think the bunch of toadies at Freedom House, funded by the State Department, USAID and the CIA could at least lend a hand and claim that Iraq and Afghanistan are Free. 
Hilary, please find enclosed $10. 
Pass it on to Freedom House but instruct them that if a country has an occupying US army it must, at least, be listed as Partly Free.

My Dear Podhoretz,
Bill Kristol, on his blurb for your book, Why Are Jews Liberals? answers, God Knows.
I know how he feels. Frankly, even on my third reading I am unable to divine what exactly youre getting at, Norman!! 
On page 277 you write, there is a fatal flaw at the heart of the theory that the liberalism of American Jews stems from the teachings of JudaismIf the theory were valid, the orthodox would be the most liberal sector of the Jewish communityfor they are most familiar with the Jewish religious traditionmost deeply influenced by its holy books
Norman, isnt this exactly equivalent to saying that the Mormons should be the most liberal community in the US because they take the Bronze Age ravings of the Old Testament seriously? 
But we all know that Mormons are a stone-mad ultra-rightwing cult, which believes God lives on a planet in the Milky Way, comport themselves in holy underwear and are rabidly anti-caffeine. And wouldnt the polygamist wing of Mormonism be even more serious than the currently monogamous?  
Now, Im not saying that the orthodox are an equally demented, rabidly irrational bunch of obscurantist loonies. The facts speak for themselves!
Norman, I know the concept is alien to you but liberal Jews may be the sane and sensible ones.
Please find enclosed a SAE and $10. (Have a snort on me!)
Could you drop me a line saying if you think I am on the right lines here?

My Dear Gates,
Are you aware of the nefarious activities of a website called Antiwar.com?
Today a grotesque individual describing himself as Commander Jeff Huber, U.S. Navy (Retired) wrote: -
our commander in Iraq, Ray The Thing Odierno, is floating the possibility of a UN peacekeeping force to replace U.S. troops in the countrys northern regionOdie has said some pretty dumb things in the past. Its as if theres no buffer between his medulla oblongata and his vocal cords; his ideas seem to spring from his deep subconscious and lunge straight into a microphone. At first glimpse, the notion that a brigade or so of UN sad sacks can accomplish what we have failed to do for seven years and change seems profoundly witless, even for the Desert Ox.
Now we all know Ray is no military genius! In his book Fiasco Thomas E. Ricks writes, internal Army Reports said that this unit (Odiernos 4th Infantry Division)  a heavy armored division, despite the name  used ham-fisted approaches that may have appeared to pacify its area in the short term, but in the process alienated large parts of the populationFourth ID fueled the insurgencyThey were cowboysEvery male from sixteen to sixtythat the 4th ID could catch was detainedAnd when they got out, they were supporters of the insurgency. 
Ok, Ray is no Clauswitz. But none of our warriors, no matter how dense, deserves to be ridiculed as, The Thing.
Please find enclosed $10, which I hope you will use to sue the scoundrels at AntiWar.com.
Sincerely
Andy Bain
