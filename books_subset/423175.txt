The Lyrical Life is a collection of carefree lyrics written for the light of heart. The songs are dramatic in nature and in no way reflect the authors philosophic perspective or personal experience. My goal is to sell these lyrics to music industry professionals.

The Lyrical Life
   

However in Teufelsdrockh, there is always the strangest Dualism: light dancing, with guitar-music, will be going on in the fore-court, while by fits from within comes the faint whimpering of woe and wail.
Thomas Carlyle

                      
No, his mind is not for rent
To any God or government
Always hopeful, yet discontent
										Rush

	







Brother Beautiful

Down the street on the darker side of town
There's a man with a tattoo gun and it's coming down
Not on another human being but into his own flesh
I don't care what the yuppies up there say

He says
This is it
Baby this is it

So she holds him tight, takes him into her body
Not trying to understand his crazy ways
And though he'd never lay an evil hand on her
The bed is pulsing midnight red

And she thinks
Despite her better judgment
"Damn, this is it
Baby this is it"

And he's neither right nor wrong
And he's either hot or cold
And his mother can't remember
Him ever doing what he was told
And the people who love him
Do so by virtue of the fact
His life is like poetry in motion
A God and devil inspired act

Tonight on Dobson Avenue, the light and polite pass
I've dined among these strangers, lifted many a halfhearted glass
But with an eye upon the flame of passion
I stand on the corner with a cigarette

Thinking to myself
Lord, this isn't it

Brother I'm not going to try to tame you
If you will just show me how to live

Then the wind lifts my chin
And I hear -
I already did

Find your passion and follow through
Not as another imitation but just as you

Cuz that is it






Step into My Heart

If youre running with no hope of home
Standing in a crowd but still all alone
And the cold has you shivering to the bone

Baby, theres a fire and its not far off
Step into my heart

I can tell youve been looking for some time
Wasting your nights on cheap men and wine
Wasting your days trying to turn a dime

Step into my heart

Im standing on the balcony looking down
But not looking down on the things youve done
Ill meet you in the street or you can come right up

Just step into the sun

Baby, theres a fire to rekindle in your heart
Im not so brusque to call it love

But kind enough
Cant you see Im kind enough?
Kind enough to say, Enoughs enough 

Step into my heart






One of These Days

Its a little bit strange
Youre feeling so deranged
Staring at the sun
But seeing nothing but rain
Dont sweat the small stuff
The radio men say
Honestly, dont worry
Its bound to get better
One of these days
Now youre dancing with a stranger
Since there are only strangers here
Darkness is your darling
The enemys always near
Then take him by the hand
It may change his mind
Or alter the heart of space
Everything will come back in time
One last line, Ill try to make it count
Damn, I just lost that thought
Like a boxer loses a round
But getting ups for posers
I dont give a damn how winners pray
Honestly, dont worry
We will all stand tall
One of these days






Going Nowhere Fast

He was dancing on the deck with a harpoon in his hand
She was serving up Captain Jack, I guess you could say on dry land
When his ship came into port, you know what happened next
He asked her for a whiskey sour, which she sweetened with her sex
After the shift, he told her plainly, This love will never last

Then they tested that truth at her place
They were going nowhere fast

Meanwhile, in the dock, the ship was ready to set sail
The boys wondered if hed found a girl, or else went back to jail
She wouldnt let him leave, had him wrapped up so tight
The sun broke through the window, but they werent done for the night
He had a vision of staying with her, now the ship was at full mast

He had no intention of getting out of bed
They were going nowhere fast

On the dresser, as she was showering, a photo caught his eye
That man is not her father, who the hell is that guy?
Then it occurred to him, hed been in that room before
In another coastal town, hell in a hundred towns or more
But he thought this girl was different, not like the others in my past

His mind was sinking in the heart of hope
He was going nowhere fast

Because when he stepped out the door
Or rather, when she threw him out
Saying, Sorry, I think we were both drunk last night
The ship had already sailed south
He was standing on a corner
Thumbing cars as they passed -

He was planning to try the big city life
He was going nowhere fast






Darling, Don't Lose

O little lady you think youve lost
The one you love, now it will cost
You a life of happiness
But thats not it
No thats not it
Your beauty lies beneath your breast
That beats so musically on his chest
Hes touching you and youre loving it
But thats not it
No thats not it
And when he goes, as we all know
The magics gone, the tears flow
You feel like Dido about to take her cliff
Thats not it
Baby, please dont slip
I saw you once standing all alone
Way up high on that same dark stone
You swore that day youd never quit
Come what may
Baby come away
That was it
Come what may
Baby seize the day
That was it
Youre a jewel unto yourself
Youre the only one who can tell
You can change the course youre on
If you choose
Youre not his pawn
Here comes the dawn
Just move on
Darling, please dont lose






Door Jam Blues

I'm wasting away here, drinking nothing but warm beer
And promises
But nobody is calling and her love is far from forthcoming
"Darling, where have you gone now?"
Though some mornings surprise me, I feel like I'm fighting
And getting a few punches in
But when you don't believe in winning, much less in sinning
Well whats it all for?

Come tomorrow they say
And who am I to walk away
When she comes knocking on my door

But baby this sad lyric is hardly even worth a lick
And my guitar is gently growling
Honestly I don't even love you, how could I after what I put you through?
And all that other shit
So go your way smiling, I don't mind the silence
I'm happier without you
And if you should return, "Damn girl, don't you ever learn?"
You could have so much more

Come tomorrow what may
Who am I to walk away 
When you come knocking at the door

Of course it's still open, I could never close it
But baby, know I tried
You should have waited a little longer, how I wish you'd been stronger
I guess we were fated for each other
But if you come back next time, eating up my sick rhyme
How can you live with yourself?
So climb into the warm bed, I'm the same damn sleepy head
But now I feel like a whore

Still come the morning
Who am I to say your love is boring
When I walk out that door






Flight of the Raven

Devil dives, dark cellar nights
Images of death, visions of light
Heavenly Tantrum in her hot tempered time
Burning for something so undefined
Things that confirm or contradict every word

Like I said shes no kindhearted bird

Fanciful in such sweet heated flesh
We touch, we taste, until nothings left
Except lost time, illusion's cold self
The fight to bring back the pleasures of hell
Sick sordid feelings that cannot be cured

Like I said shes no kindhearted bird

One last flourish, her hand on my mouth
My hand on her sex, perfume flowing out
Danger dance, the tuck and extend
The rocking disease, joys never mend
Until we grasp what dread ecstasy heard

Fly away
Into the gray
Into the black
Into the fray
Fly away you cruel, o so beautiful bird






Sad Girl

She danced alone in the light of the moon
And said, I feel just like some witch that I saw in a cartoon
She cried six tears but they were not hers
And if they are, she thought, I can never know for sure -
I am too alone and so afraid
There may not be a world outside the one weve made
With our minds and in our lust
She took out a five-dollar bill, it said, In God We Trust
Then she laughed, and she laughed again
I dont know you but I believe - Abraham Lincoln - 
Theres a way out of here
With that said she took off her dress and pounded down a beer
Under the stars, by the sea 
Fourscore and seven years ago everyone was free
Under the stars, by the sea
Fourscore and seven years ago everyone was free
But is that really true? this sad girl asked
Even then there was sin and people still wore masks
So what have we lost, and what have we gained?
Theres another man on the moon but he doesnt look the same
As he did before they dropped the bomb
But who really gives a damn - Im cute, Im smart, Im strong

By now the girl was drunk, or just say she was stoned
On these thoughts that wanted God or a call from Davy Jones
O that boys so stupid, but heaven knows it's fun
And I better get my kicks while I am still young
Under the stars, by the sea
Fourscore and seven years ago everyone was free
Yeah, under the stars, by the sea
Fourscore and seven years ago everyone was free

So she grabbed her cell-phone, reached out for him
Put the five dollars on the water, Goodbye Abe Lincoln
Then her body trembled and her heart was full of mirth
Abe Lincoln was drowning and pounding in the surf
Then they knelt together, kindly kissed their mother earth
Abe Lincoln was drowning and pounding in the surf

She danced alone in the light of his gaze
And said, I feel just like some heroine stranded on the stage






Brother, Talk to Me 

Hes a king in his own mind
still the queen's so hard to find
standing there stuck in a crazy pose
dilapidated David with a half bit rose
o man where'd you look today?
isn't it getting a little hard to pray
with your prospects as good as gone
and everybody's asking what drug you're on
but it's o.k. you have a right to be

whatever you want, but brother talk to me

cuz I've got an ear, been there before
and even if my girl isn't walking out the door
that doesn't mean I can't relate
with a heart growing hard and learning to hate
so let's have a talk, straight from the heart
you know that's where all the big steps start
and it's not hopeless, you're not alone
what's it going to take to break the heart of stone
that has you standing there like a petrified tree

what is it brother, just talk to me

yes it's true, just as I said
no it's not true you'd be better off dead
there are many good things coming your way
just as sure as the night is followed by day
so look to the stars or the shimmering sea

what is it brother, just talk to me






Old Souls

Youve got to be cool enough to kill
Old enough to know
Where the road gets rough
And where the flowers grow
With a hand held out for cutting
Your lips pressed against her heart
Between Arkansas and Saturday
It seemed like the place to start

So I told you all my memories
The human history of good and bad
Then you told them back to me
In a tone that was so sad
I cannot hear anyone ever again

"Happiness, the rose," you laughed
"Hell, a hecklers scorn"
I loved you standing over me
Like the morning I was born
So I let you use me terribly
Beautifully in black
With the whip of Satans heaven
Cracking at my back

Still you told me all your memories
Of your mother and your dad
Then I told them back to you
In a tone that was so sad
You said you couldn't love anyone ever again

Though that was then, the Song says
Yet were here again tonight
Laughing like two lunatics
And fighting just to fight
But when the stone of Beggars Bed
Falls back into the sea
Yes in that little cove, by that little cave
My little dove come back to me

He was the saddest Man to walk the earth
Storm clouds forming at His heels
And Tambourine and Tantra girls
Whirling down the street like sawdust wheels
The Carpenter, the Music said
The Wind, the Carpenter lushly bled
This bed we lay upon tonight, my love
Will never be the same again

Laughing, laughing, laughing
Laughing, laughing, laughing
Laughing, laughing, laughing
All the way






Song of the Sun

Theres music in the forest and Im moving to it
Woke early this morning like I already knew it
Blonde haired lady wearing a veil of black
If I go to her now, I doubt Ill be coming back
Theres beauty in the places forgotten by men
The ladies love me, and Lord I love them
As we turn our backs on the bloody battle of doom
And I dont give a damn about who does what to whom

Then the women whisper, Friend its time to go
But only heaven knows where the wind might blow
I've just been touched by the world's most tender thought
Now I'm dancing with the women on the stairway back to God

Meanwhile as the sun is setting on the sea
Theres a black eyed angel rising right through me
Im going to follow that star, if I have to give up the ghost
Take all my treasures and find a cave on the coast
O glory of Elijah, of Samson, and Moses
I want to gather all that glory along with the roses
Falling down on me wet, the dew of light and grace
Theres a girl named Sarah kissing up and down my face

Then the angels whisper, Friend its time to go
But only heaven knows where the wind might blow
I've just been touched by the Lord's most tender thought
Now I'm dancing with the angels on the stairway back to God

O life Id forgotten it could be so full
I grab the beast by the horns and then I ride the bull
I can toss a tiger in the mighty strength of the Lord
All I need is the Spirit breathing in the blade of my sword
O holy Hallelujah how I praise you Christ
Youre my music in the morning and my light at night
With you by my side theres nothing that cant be done
Since its in my mind now Im gonna ride on the wings of the sun

Show the whole damned world how it was meant to be sung
  





Space Soldier

Space soldier understood by few
Not really liked by the ones that do
He's looking down from a different point of view
Never knowing but he wishes he knew
The answers to questions few dare to ask
Finding these answers is his ultimate task
Flying through space, he whispers and moans
All by himself but he's not alone

Space, space soldier
Strange Joe

As a child the boy had a vision
Since that time he hasn't felt much like living
In the world that denies him the star
That once gave light to his cold dark heart
"Was it an angel, or was it the devil?"
He believes in God but he's such a strange fellow
So he left the earth and since then has flown
Across the heavens in search of a home

Space, space soldier
Strange Joe

Sometimes I wonder is it all a dream
Or is this life as strange as it seems
Haven't seen her for such a long time
But still can't get her out of my mind
Before I met her I couldn't even cry
Nor did I laugh or even ask why
A man is born to this human race
Destined to search for himself out in space

Anyway tonight that's where I roam
In my little spaceship and through the great unknown

Space, space soldier
Where do you go?
Space, space soldier
Do you even know?
Space, space soldier
Where the wind blows?
Space, space soldier
Strange Joe






Hell and Hodgepodge Stew

All I pray, now I know you hear my heart
No fear of losing face
No need to say, if I didn't write it out
For the world to read or sing
As if damnation could negate purity or fate
All I pray is, since you've been so clearly
Cooing me with broken silence
Standing beside me in the dark
All I pray is, on my high horse
All I pray is, let them be forever with you
Even if it costs me, what it cost you
Then take me too
Take me too
One step closer to your prayer
A single thought away from truth
So candles line this broken time
The dancers with their naked breasts
The sorrow souls who feast on death
The devil's rage alive in money
O so  heavy  now
With such a breathless glow
Happy hordes of discontent
The last laugh mongrels
Grave lament, in solemn, shiny blue
Then take me too 
Take me too
One step closer to your prayer
A single thought away from truth
So we work to save our souls
And we die to live our lives
The clichs are never ending
But if the night were not so cold and gray
If you were not cloaked in such an earnest yearning
When the Breaker himself is broken
By what we think we are within
The cross-fire carriage charging
High upon the hills of Who Hates Who
Then take me too
Take me too
One step closer to your prayer
A single thought away from truth
Don't ask too much, the human touch
Could drown you in such an all consuming
Chaos, and that chaos could be home
If only you knew how to reach
The self that will surely grow  in time 
Then touch him there
And stroke her hair
Or wait it out, religiously
The final plea or first real laugh
Yeah dipshit, give up all you have!
Of course it's what you must do
Then take me too
Take me too
One step closer to your prayer
(Yes, I'll meet you there)
After we proudly overshoot the truth
I pray, o how I pray 
A thousand hellish worlds fall down on you






Russian Bride

Bonny, Beatrice, Number Nine
"We're all her in the heat of the night," she said
As she stumbled out of bed
And lit herself a pipe
Nearly nineteen in her painted on jeans
Good God the girl was ripe

Met her at a club called Eden
She was dancing all alone
Didn't notice me for a couple of songs
Clearly the girl was stoned
Told me her name was Mary
Just kept calling me Jane
I said, "Hey, I think you're kind of cute"
She said, "You must be insane"

Bonny, Beatrice, Number Nine
"I really hope my train arrives on time," she laughed
"Because this body's all I have
And there's really nothing left to lose
Gonna be a bride by midnight tonight
Then I'll have no more need of you" 

Bonny, Beatrice, Number Nine
"Should I even bother to wave goodbye?" I asked
As her train slowly pulled away
He was a rich old man with a Coppertone tan
And wearing a green beret
So with my hands in my pants
I guess, "It's all about chance"
And there's really nothing left to say






Picker Uppers
(Bottom Feeders)

Said he needed a picker up
A picker up, to pick her up
Said he needed a picker up
I wonder what he wants
She said shed be over in a little while
Arrive in style
With sex appeal and smiles
Said shed be over in a little while
But he's been waiting for her all night

So he asks the dark to speak
The light to reap
What the soul does keep
So he asks the heart to hear
The prayer that knows no fear

Said she needed a golden ring
Boots from Spain
And many other things
Said she needed a servant who sings
I wonder what she wants
He told her he'd be there before too long
Looking strong, singing her favorite song
Told her he'd be there before too long
But she's been waiting for him all night

So she asks the dark to speak
The light to reap
What the soul does keep
So she asks the heart to hear
The prayer that knows no fear

Said he needed a picker up
She said she needed something too
They met together after dark
Where the neon lights are blue
And nobody 
I mean nobody
Where nobody 
I mean nobody
Not a single soul breaks through






Terribly Beautiful

is there a distance?
is there a dream?
is there a state of mind
a way to find
why things are never 
what they seem?
and is there a vision?
at dawn, a gentle call?

then rest here in wonder, children
for God loves us all

though there is darkness
and paralyzing doubt
sometimes in the midnight hour 
joy keeps flowing out
and there's just no stopping
the way I truly feel
but she is gone, and he is gone
and nothing is for real

then hide here in the shelter, children
for the devil's at the wheel

so I stumble blindly 
through the crooked gray
all my thoughts are scattered
like the words I say
"o nobody knows me,
and really whats a self?
que sera sera I guess 
only time will tell"

still we spin so freely
on this beautiful blue-green ball

then rest here in wonder, children 
the good Lord loves us all






Miss Molly's Dollhouse

If you're happy being lonely
And you're happy being poor
If you're happy being tired
And you never root for more

If you like the way she scolds you
And you love the way she looks
Standing there like Krishna
While you're hanging from her hook

Then open up your wallet
Simply shut your mouth
We have a bed for you my friend
In Miss Molly's tall dollhouse

Where winters are just Winter
And each summer's like the last
As your sipping lukewarm coffee
Reminiscing about the past 

Which, if you are honest
Was as humdrum as today 
And you're sitting there in stitches
Without your own words to say

Then open up your wallet
Simply shut your mouth
We have a bed for you my friend
In Miss Molly's tall dollhouse

O my silly sexless darlings
The dearest children of the bunch
I'm not condescending sweetheart 
Would you like a cup of punch?

When you dream of masturbation
On the bottom or the top
And even now you're praying
That she'll ask you to stop

Then kiss her with compassion
Button up her blouse
Assume the pose of wine and roses
In Miss Molly's tall
In Miss Molly's wall
In Miss Molly's dream dollhouse






Death to My Anima 
(A Jungian Trope)

'It's a private party'
She said in her sleep
'For happy-go-lucky
People to meet
In carnival times
And carnival ways'
Then I woke her
And I swear
She's been crying for days

O sweet seorita
Your body is true
But your mind never knows
What your spirit might do
So you slap me with kindness
Then you kiss me so cold
I swear
It makes me feel
Ten million years old

No seaside retreat
To the Malibu coast
Could cure you from thinking
That all hope is lost
So I tell you you're pretty
And I tell you you're cruel
And by the end of the night
(I swear)
I'll be playing the fool

'It's a private party'
She said in her sleep
'For happy-go-lucky
People to meet
In carnival times
And carnival ways'
Then I killed her
And I swear
I've been laughing for days






Can You Dance?

Can you dance?
Thats all I want to know
Can you dance?

I fear you will say no

Do you sing the sunset?
You havent told me yet
Are you happy?

Why not let your answer be yes?

Theres a hollow
In Saint Luis
Where I met a man
He held a joker in his teeth
And a bottle in his hand
Yes, I've met with him one too many times
Its sad to say but true
So forgive me if for the moment
I let the darkness answer you

Will we sail the dawn together?
Bathe our bodies in the sea?
Tell me can you dance, my love?

Why wont you answer me?

And are you lonely
Or just hollow to the core?
Were you wounded badly

In that old mans war?

Theres a height
In Switzerland
One night I saw a star
Yes, Ive read the books you like
But they never look that far
So I lost my footing more than once
And made the summit at least twice
Will I come down to unlace your gown?
Lover, roll the dice!

Can I keep the needle then 
If you leave behind this pain?
Forgive me if I curse you, brother,

And fire bullets at the rain


 



The Unlikely Thought of Freedom

The equipment is broken
This place is a dump
I want to make love
But she wants to hump
What do you say
When fresh fruit turns rotten?

I guess not a lot
If youre on the bottom

And if youre renting in hell
She slyly remarks
You dont complain about the plumbing
Or about the dark
So I sip on her sweet tea
Which tastes more like cotton

I guess thats the lot
Of those on the bottom

Yet theres a new thought
Ablaze in the mind
Of one who knows life 
Is not work in the Grind
A truth, which, if trusted
Would take the bad breaks weve gotten

And dash them to hell
As we fly free through the ceiling






Song of the Pseudo-Copper

He looks like a cop
And he talks like a cop
And he walks like a cop
But he's not a cop
He's a huh
He's o haaha
He's a....

He's an undercover lover
Brother of your mother
Holding up the store
Or knocking on your door
But not here to arrest you
Just to undress you
Like a neighbor with a reason
Regardless of the season
Nah, I'm just teasing

Cuz if he looks like a cop
And he talks like a cop
And he walks like a cop
'Hey, he's a cop!'

Though on occasion
He's been seen out drinking
Acting rather naughty
With a downtown hottie
Placing bets on red
Without regrets
Until come morning
And she starts snoring
And asking for cash
So then he flashes his badge

Cuz if he looks like a cop
And he talks like a cop
And he walks like a cop
'Hey, you're a cop!'

And he's a high-top walker
Neon sign stalker
Dust devil rocker
Fancy pants shopper
Once taken for a robber
But he's still a Copper
Cyndi Lauper pleasing
Fat like Jackie Gleason
Nah, I'm just teasing

Cuz if he looks like a cop
And he talks like a cop
And he walks like a cop
'Hey, he's a cop!'

Yeah, he looks like a cop
And he talks like a cop
And he walks like a cop
But he's not a cop
He's a huh
He's o haaha
He's a....
He's a huh huh
He's o haaha haa
He's rah rah rah

Just a man of the law
Just a doin' his job

Just a phony ass cop

Kickin' it live
Makin' it jive
Rockin' the house
Takin' them out
Watchin' her back
Smoking that crack






Rock Progeny
(Knock on Wood)

Set her on the edge
Tip her like a top
Take her to the limit, boy
And don't you dare stop

Dance her to the dawn
Twirl her like a beast
Send her to the dogs
And then laugh during the feast

O no we are not that good
But we'll be better than this someday 
Knock on wood

Above you like the dark
Descending through the haze
The rock-a-billy boys
With their rock-a-billy ways

First the music makes her laugh
Your second shot at love
Then her laughter makes you cry
O hell you've had enough

O no we are not that good
But we'll be better than this someday
Knock on wood

Finally or finale
Standing alone one night
While the fire-cracker derby
Escorts her out of sight

Only you can see him
The man you'll soon become
Kill him if you can, my Cain
Or love him, my dear son

O no we are not that good
But we'll be better than this someday 
We'll be better than this I pray
We'll be better than this someday
Knock on wood






Let It Ring

She was not yet a woman
So much more than a child
Saw me coming years before then
I told her my name
She just looked away
I said, Look up, Ill be back again

So it rang like a hymn
When the blood touched my hand
When my hand touched the hem of his gown
She was there too, for that matter so were you
It was a once in a lifetime kind of sound

The Ferris-wheel love
Was never enough
So much more than one would expect
There was a calm in her eyes
Despite her sad lies
Like a pleasure no man could reject

I didnt think twice
She said, once is our lot
I chided her then for no reason
The orchard was dying
While the vineyard was rising
Soul to flesh, two were one, for a season

So it rang like a hymn
When the blood touched my hand
When my hand touched the hem of his gown
She was there too, for that matter so were you
It was a once in a lifetime kind of sound

The voice of a girl
The Spirit of Christ
Wisdom that can only cause tears
I forget her name
But nobodys to blame
Im back for you love, dont you fear 

So we held to a hymn
When the breath touched bone
When I exhaled and then took to wing
Then she was not there, but I felt for her still
It was a joy only one Man could sing

I just laughed: let it ring, let it ring!"





 
Lighting Up 
(The Lord's Cup)

You could say that she's my baby
You could say that I'm her love
And the two of us together
Are filling the Lord's cup

Though happiness until this time
Has eluded us with her spark
From here to Eternity
We're lighting up the world's dark

They say that this world's cruelty
Can crush the faith of the strongest soul
So you and I together
Will bite the thorn off of every rose

For the passion and the pain
These each play a part
In the way we come together
And light up the world's dark

So dance for me, my beautiful girl
You know that I love you so
Under the moon, in the early Spring
Where the purple Lilacs grow

Then if you call me 'lover'
Well that's just what I am
Singing to you in the morning light
And taking you by the hand

You could say that she's my lady
You could say that I'm her man
And the two of us together
Are making one last stand

As the angels dance above our bed -
Sing out like a lark:
"The time is now fulfilled dear friends,
Come out of the dark!"

So now we drink of this life's joy and sorrow
With cheerfulness and pride
Till we're all out of day
And we're all out of night

Yes, we're all out of day, my love
For the Good Lord is our light 






Own Up to It

Who is this gorilla 
And why is this sad fellow
Searching for a flower
That last night fell upon the floor?

And where is all the music
Promised for our marriage
The carriage lit by candles
Or the candle lit by God?

And who are you, Majestic
Standing there so sternly
Mocking me in tandem
With a cat that holds my tongue?

Space diamond, once I said it
It was sailing through the ether
Like a prayer without true fervor
Or inspiration to make it home

So dance then, if we must die
Fling me across your shoulder
Though heavier than doldrums
Pretend that I am light

And when the night is over
My white garden lover
Let's return to the river
Let's paint it black as blood

'Dear Jesus,' he's not absent
Unless we keep on trying
To make a dead man's ceremony 
Tick in time with ours 

Sweet mistress, once I touched you
It was like witnessing a murder
Of every false ambition, guile
That stood between us and home






Learning to Fly
(Love American-Style)

If youre tired and youre lonely
Lonelier than Sin
Who cannot find a soul tonight
Willing to dance with him
And your whipping boy is all whipped out
Still he's whipping back with force
Remember my son though things are bad
They might still get worse
So hitch your carriage to a star
Hitch your star unto a girl
Find an automobile that looks like you feel
And travel the whole damned world
Which for the moment
Is a single blade of grass
Because America is exhausted
And this thing doesn't run on gas

But on dreams and dreams
Like other machines
Built from piss and puss and sweat
And as they say,
'If you're breathing boy,
You are not dead yet'

But on your way to gallows' songs
Or weak, marginal dissent
It's a day in the life of a Disney dog
Or a panda's cold footprint
No, forget that tone of dark despair
There's a world beyond yourself
Now break the blinds on your closet time
Rise up on roller-coaster stilts
Yes, see the world and God behind
Beautiful, terrible, true
When all your mistakes are behind you
There are only new things to do
And though she turns and laughs out loud
'Fucking symphony of fools!'
There's comfort in this guiding thought
Even she doesn't have the tools

But dreams and dreams
Like other machines
Built from piss and puss and shit
And as they say,
'If you're bleeding boy,
You are not dead yet'

But here today to get the feel
For the anti-hero's grace
So fall through the floor of your evermore
Behold His beautiful face
Then with your body pocket-less
Pulsing with an angel's blood
Whatever you see or hear or think
Is just another name for love
Because when it's all said and done
Only one thing counts
Did you ride the bull of time with pride?
Did you make the back seat bounce?
Or if not, know this much
And fairy tales don't lie
You have a whole eternity 
To learn how not to die

So dream just dream
Like the other machines
Too afraid to raise their head
And as they say,
'If you're living badly,
You're as good as dead'






3 Free 4 Tonight

You say we need 
A little reprieve
Little baby on my sleeve
My lady am I ready for this?
Just yesterday it was just the two of us
O I need to let go
Of all my fears
Damned ego
We need to open up
To new life

But dont call it love
No, dont call it love

So we walk
Down the street without looking back
Girl holding our hands
Wind at our backs
We are making it
As you take from your purse
For our daughter two gloves

But dont call it love
No, dont call it love

Because its deeper than that
Its purer than that
Its stronger than that
So tired of what all the liars have said
No love song needed tonight
Tuck her in for the night
Now we have time
Just you and I
Just you and I

So much more like
Just you and I

With her by our side






Sure as Sin

Im not the man you think I am
Im crazy and Im cruel
I once did things by the book
Until I burned the golden rule
And if God loves me
I hope to hell I fall in love with Him
They say this stubbornness will kill me

Kill me, sure as sin

So damn all this loneliness
This loveless lack of faith
Id sell my soul to anyone
Whod help me find my place
Though that is neither here nor there
Someday we all will win
They say this vanity will kill me
 
Kill me, sure as sin

So farewell all you good old boys
Good night my bad news girls
I cannot stay another night
In this hotel called the world
With no cure and no care
Nor friend nor foe nor kin
They say this wanderlust will kill me

Kill me, sure as sin

I know the look of the man in the mirror
And I feel his icy touch
If hes still alive tomorrow
I wont love him half as much
Or Ill miss him in a different sense
As if hed never been
Born to play this poker game that will break me

Break me, sure as sin

So dance with me my lovely girl
Since I knew you long ago
Before we were born to love or learn
Or hate or heal or know
That everything upon this earth
And all thats ever been
Will fall like fruit from an evil tree

Unbelievably sweet as sin

Then sing your song soft and low
Or sing it loud and hard
You cannot choose your death
But you can hold these cards
A joker and a jack
Three skulls and two redskins
They say this blood-feud will kill us all

Kill us, sure a s sin

But if not for this sorrow
The heartache and the pain
If it wasnt for this sad song
Tell me what would remain?
And if the whole thing hadn't been set up
To fall like Satans pins
I guess the Man would never have come to say

Repent of all these sins!

I guess the Man would never have come to pray
For you and her and him

I guess the Man would never have come to say
You must be born again!






Natural Grace

A womans body knows the struggle
Hands deep in the soil know the same
Theres a wisdom that warfare lends to the soul
And then selflessly draws back again 
But none of these touch or even come close to
The lovely you look on this night
More than a likeness to dawn or new birth

Just the moment the whole world went quiet

A curly-haired boy, my son plays in the sand
His mother knows his story by heart
I was parking the car but there was no space
So I earned a ticket and heard a dog bark 
Its really not news to say 'this country is dead'
Or to hear a pure saint curse the light
But it wasnt like anything I ever heard sung

Just the moment the whole world went quiet

Theres a grace in the way the tide tumbles down
This grace you cant trace, not at all
Not even a prayer you can point to or say
Since she kisses you after the fall
So it happened that I was not hungry or angry
Not dreaming abyss or great height
Just sitting there idle, loving and laughing

The moment the whole world went quiet






A Father's Farewell 
   
If they leave you alone
To compose this song
Thank the good Lord
For everything gone wrong
Like the loss of your wife
The dream of girls and boys
In that day my son
Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice

If they throw you a bone
And say, 'go break a leg'
Pretend for them my friend
That you were born to beg
Then laugh until it's true
'Life is nothing more than toys'
In that day my son
Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice

Because there's beauty in the bloodbath
If the bullets are made of gold
When the best you can do in all the world
Is orgasm and grow old
And that's hardly as lovely as learning how to fly
In that day my son  be glad that you can die

Then if your artwork strikes back
Screams just like a bitch
And in spite of your silent prayers
You get filthy rich
Well that's alright too
Sometimes God likes to make noise
In that day my son
Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice

But when your hand starts to wither
And your nightmares remark
"The human race is only hopeful
When left out in the dark"
Remember our conversations
As if you really had a choice
In that day my son
Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice

Because there's beauty in the forest
If the forest is pure flame
When the least of these in heaven
Walk tall and without shame
And that's so much sweeter than learning how to cry
In that day be glad my son  you will never have to die






All the Time

It would be nice to know what I did wrong
Since Im trying to sing your favorite song
But you never shoot straight from the hip
So pin your lips with butter clips
Pretend were on the up and up
Ill love you till its time to start again
But if I mispronounce the place
Where I first saw your face
Or confuse you with another or a dog
Pardon me, Im not all here
And I dont know the meaning of fear
I tell it like it is all the time

All of the time
All of the time
All of the time
Im nothing less than a shadow of your death 

And dancing never suited us
Like making love on the bus
Bumping where we should of learned to fly
So you said you were happier
In the midst of the blur
Brought on by a drug and something else
But when we tried to recreate the event
At the end of the night we were all spent
Then we both agreed it could never be the same
Still we tried time and again
Until the beginning of the bitter end
And crying I laughed you to sleep all the time

All of the time
All of the time
All of the time
Im nothing less than a shadow of your life

And hate and fear and hope and lust
And trusting all that never was
Waiting in vain for what had come and gone
Rocking to the melody
But no longer just in our sleep
We both sang deep and let  let it be

All of the time
All of the time
All of the time
You're nothing more than a shadow of my dream






Sour Grapes

You give me a vineyard, babe
I'll give you a grape
You give me a kiss, just then
I may love you all my days
I don't mean to suggest that that was a test
I'm simply trying to invest 
In what I know is safe
Because I gave my last lass my last dime
And that dame left the state
Before I became irate
Sour grapes
But no, not you, you're so sweet
The kind of girl I'd like to meet
If you give me a drum roll, darling
I'll bust a rhyme out on your beat
Clap your hands, laugh, stamp and dance
Then I must admit I've been left with two left feet
And my dancing days are through
Sour grapes
Girl I thought you knew
But no, not you, you're so sweet
The kind of girl I'd like to meet
If you keep up that drum roll, baby
I don't mind if you do
Although I'm deaf, dumb and mute
I can see - and you're so cute
The kind of girl I'd like to
O I long to love you
Girl without restraint
But my faith in man and all his kinds
Has kind of lost its strength
Now I just let it sag
Sour grapes
So you can clip my toenails, lady
If I can pull out your hair
And I'll give you a flower, lover
If you pull out a mirror
And point it here at my face
Because you know what I love
And you know that I like
Sour grapes
And we can rub-a-dub-dub in my bathtub tonight
If you meet me here 
At my back porch
At my back door
You see it's raining down cats and dogs
And I'm not too hip on getting wet
But I can see you've already been bit
By a rabid dog in a maddened fit
But when you arrive only knock twice
Because I might be asleep
And you know what I want
And you know that I need -
Beauty, beauty, beauty
Beauty and the beast
The bitterness we all must reap
In the name of love
But no, not you, you're so sweet
The kind of girl I'd like to
O I long to love you
Girl without restraint
Still my faith in man and all his kinds
Has kind of lost its strength
Now I just let it sag
Sour grapes
Let me talk to you today about the Pharisee
One who desires to be free
But refuses to take or break the bread for conscience sake
For who knows what his hands might have touched
Or where the woman sitting next to him might have been
Let me talk to you today about the young Republican
Burning, burning with rage
On the right side of the stage
Dancing the Witches' Sabbath with flaming virgins and old maids
Chanting, 'Sour-sour-sour-grapes'
The kind of game we all must play
In the name of blood
Blind-blind-blind man's bluff
Where good is never bad enough
Still the cynics say, 'So what?'
So if you decide, you want to learn to fight
I will wait till you return
One up - victorious
One betrayed by a kiss
Then burning, burning with rage
I may learn to trust your hate
I may turn and lust you babe
Sour-sour-sour
Sour grapes

(And you may call it treason
Still sour grapes
Make great raisins)






Austin Tea-Bag

Caffeine and Mary Jane 
are making love at last
while Lilac Wine, fresh as the vine 
washes away our past
and darling shapes and sizes 
coalesce with tiger-force
and as bad as things have become 
they could still be worse
so drink to Christ's sure coming 
or your own indecision
because you should be doing something else
but you just can't catch the vision
then let the caffeine fuel your fever
let the wine cool your blood
and let Mary Jane, dear friend of fools
do just what she does






Free Wild Bird

Took me a while to smile, honey
Took me even longer to laugh
Come over here and light my candle
Or I'll be over there to bubble your bath
Yes laughter is a remedy for all things
And sorrow is a cage, so I've heard
Like the ballad of a thin man
Or Oscar living in a trash can
But baby I'm one free wild bird
So dance me to the darkness, sweetly
Then darken me during the dance
True saints are neither sexless nor loveless
Come over here, let's make some romance
And I'll caress you with heavenly music
Or I'll stroke you with one dirty word
Like we're fresh out of luck
Or else in need of a buck
But baby I'm one free wild bird
Crazy as it sounds to say it of one self
If I didn't, well I'd forget who I am
Then sooner or later I'd turn into a hater
And damn that would be a hell of a jam
So one more time for good time's sake
Go ahead, call me a crazy-ass nerd
Like a man on a mission
Or a sea-hawk out fishin'
But baby I'm one one free wild bird 






Forty Days 

Forty days, forty ways to kill a man
I've been riding across this open country
Just trying to make a stand
Staying low, beneath the bells of fear
Laughing alone like hollow bones
But I can hear them drawing near
The dogs of death, the hounds of vengeful love
Fighting for this hallowed ground
That they call, 'the field of blood'
Where one lay, who gave his life for many
Though when he walked the earth he made
He did not earn a penny

O Lord, tonight I am so cold
O Lord, I feel I'm growing old
Before my time
Before my time
And there's a man standing at the door
Saying, 'Sign the dotted line'

Damn you mister landlord
You ugly millionaire
Unless you give your life for love
And truly learn to share
What you own with those better than yourself
Wall Street president, you must repent
Forsake all your wealth
Then you will be truly rich indeed
But as it is you only build
Another monument for greed
And if you say, Well, divided we fall
To hell with all your rhetoric
And your bloody whitewashed wall

O Lord, tonight I am so cold
O Lord, I feel I'm growing old
Before my time
Before my time
And there's a man standing at the door 
Saying, 'Sign the dotted line'

And the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo
And the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo
And the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo

Babylon, the beautiful
You whore

 




Family Man

He breaks his back from nine to five
Just to feed his family
"I wouldn't be much of a man," he says
If I can't give them what they need
And I watch him as he works
Think it must be a sin
When he gives life all he's got

But it doesn't give much back to him

The kids are growing up
He's happy to see them strong
His son and daughter get straight A's
But by now his wife is gone
She wanted something more I guess 
More bread than he could bring in
Still he has nothing but love for her

How the hell could she hate him?

Tonight he's kicking back
I wouldn't say a lonely man
His kids still say he's the best
And they visit when they can
I love my brother and I think
He's the best man who's ever been
Tomorrow night we will hit the bars

Im gonna treasure my time with him






Prayer

locked in this drama we call life, sorrow, sex, and strife
human fears and fantasies that never set us free
while God, dwelling in pure peace, upon the wild seas
wants us all to know where the Spirit flows
so I get a glimpse of glory, start to live my story 
content and squeaky clean, pretending to believe
till I turn to find myself between heaven and hell
as my plans just like a rock, take me to the top

Then we, laughing in the sun
Naked for no one
I feel we have begun
Like a dream to break away
At least my little darling that's what I pray

once out of the depths of night without the will to fight 
her angel face appeared, as if in a magic mirror
'hey, have we met before?' another closed white door
because that sorry line's been used a million times
still I pass her on the street, and she smiles at me
with a kindness in her eyes that never tells a lie
but tonight in a neon club, or another smoky pub
the world drinks down its sorrow to forget about tomorrow

Then we, laughing in the sun
Naked for no one
I feel we have begun
Like a dream to break away
At least my little darling that's what I pray

now that I've become a man, I do all that I can
I do all that I want, according to His love
still you see me on the stage, ticking off with rage
playing these little games, in the name of fate
for I fall standing alone, or when I cast a stone
trying to be a star, girl tell me who you are
because you come to me in visions, shaking off red ribbons
all these things that you possess, thinking that you're blessed

Then we, laughing in the sun
Naked for no one
I feel we have begun
Like a dream to break away
At least my little darling that's what I pray






If You Dont Have a Home

Oil-well Harry
Has so much money its scary
Landslide Charlie
As his name suggests
Is just doing his best
But whether youve got a million
Or barely one working bone

Man, you aint got a thing
If you dont have a home

Of course all homes 
Arent houses
Or is it, 
All houses arent homes?
And many a family member
Hates the month of December
And wants to be left alone

Id give away this damn mansion, 
The rich man says with passion
For one loving home

So I set sail
Way, way, way back when
I thought I was a man
I was just a child then
And Ive seen the whole world
Gathered enough experience 
To know

Man, you aint got a damn thing
If you dont have a home

Spent enough time out in the cold
To know

You are lost in this world
Without a home






Age of Aquarius

Children, in the sun
Wondering how fast they can run
And how far, how far?
The sun is just a star
And the star was once a prayer
And you can feel the love of God
everywhere

So I walk alone
Across the greenest afternoon
Casting stones and throwing stars
Right back at the moon
It's all here, it's all here
Though it can't be seen at all
Sorrow stalks our happiness
And she always stands too tall

Grown men, in the night
Wrestling with wrong and right
And why, and when?
The night cries out with sin
And these men know how to swear
And you can't find a trace of God
anywhere 

So she waits for me
On her bed, across the sea
Singing something insensible
About the birds and bees
'Where's he gone? What went wrong?
Didn't he like my song?
Maybe I'm just too pretty - 
Too pretty or too strong!' 

Let my lovely man of war come home
Leave my lovely man of peace alone

But in between the music and the sweat
(The passion and the flight)
The sweat of brow and bow
The beat of heart and hell
The saddest refrain, unspeakable pain
On the other side, where dark and light
So the poets say
(Where laughter, sex, and second sight
Tumble blindly through deep space)
In between the nightmare and the dream
The dream of God - undone
Forsaken, fallen, risen, hidden
Where moon makes love to sun
Find him there, find her here
Find him, after all, my dear
'Father, father, father' - 
I pray for these, but not for those
Yes, in between the thorn nail and the rose
Shadow, silhouette, and specter join 
Forming the clearest call on earth
'I tell you the truth, you must...'
So perhaps I'll come back and speak with you, my love
After my birth

Children, in the sun
O my children, won't you come
O my children, won't you come

And steer me clear of false ambitions
And keep her from the futile thought of me






Shaman Jakob
(A Personal Apocalypse)

So the next time you win the world I say
I hope you learn you were not born to play
The part of a king, a pauper, a pawn
But down in the trench with a pretty young blonde
Let's say or suppose you hand her a rose
Which ignites the night, so beautifully glows        
And she, in turn, hands her bare heart to you

Then you know in heaven, child
Every sweet dream comes true

So just lay back and point to the sky
Watch the color of pallor turn into pie
Because the shape of all illusion
Despite the stars of your contusion
May suit you better than the rest
Whether you passed or failed the test
You stand at the altar unable to say 'I do'

Then you know in heaven, child
Even bad dreams come true

Finally strung out on happier trails
Where the heart shines bright, after all love fails
To move you to tears or conjure old fears
Not one in a million will find you here
As the way swings off like hyena laughter
And the fools all jeer at happy ever after
Now try to forget what you once thought you knew

Then you know in heaven, child
Every single dream comes true

But who ever said you'd be better of dead?
Who ever bled to to take a lady to bed?
Who got a divorce just to marry a horse?
Who? Who? Who? Who?
Sure every thing's sweeter for those born anew
Like to fly or to cry or goodbye - 'boo whou'
But who ever told you to look so blue?
Who? Who? Who? Who?

O my sad prince of bad
O my pure knight of sad
O my bad actor of cause
Forget your loss
Fire the boss -
It's you!

Then you know in heaven
Holding the number seven
Filled to the brim with leaven
I think you'll know when the four winds blow
Even nightmares come true

Boom    Boom    Boom
Chalka, Chalka, Chalka
Boom    Boom    Boom
Chalka, Chalka, Chalka
Boom    Boom    Boom
Chalka, Chalka, Chalka 
Boom






Santa-Anna

The night wind was blowing
But now it has settled 
Theres a rustling
A darkness, a pang
Two figures emerge 
From behind the faade
(For the life of me)
I cant remember her name

It was August or else
Maybe November
The dead of night 
A phrase, how it rang
She asked me to kiss
Away all her memories
So I did it 
And then I did it again

We were not born
For battle, dear sir
She told me
Free from all shame
For she did not need
Nor did I see
A reason
To point out the blame

Santa Ana, my thirst
Answered in prayer
Where thought becomes
Body and time
Yes we were lovers
Our souls unlike others
"Was it you, then, who 
Asked me to shine?"
 

The night wind was blowing
But now it has settled 
Theres a rustling
A darkness, a pang
A lady comes forth 
From behind the faade
(For the life of me)
I cant stop saying her name
  






The Happy Sun

O misty mamma
It's not as bad as it seems
I know you say you see me 
Sometimes in your dreams
And it's a happy go lucky
It's a-hurry-here-after
It's along for the ride
On the train named laughter

The train named laughter
On the train named laughter that runs
South of the border
Through the lonely hearts quarter
To a little bar they call the Happy Sun
Where even lifetime losers
And beautiful bruisers
And girls with a grudge can have fun

And it's a whipping wild time
It's a hairball rhyme 
It's a crazy bloody night on the town
So tell me some secret
So I know where you keep it 
My love is one circus call show
And as the curtain wing falls
And you're kicking my balls
I guess I'll say it's about time to go
But before I leave
With another girl on my sleeve
I swear we could of had a-fine-ever-after'
Instead of ticking the tock
And clicking the clock
We should of tried the train named laughter

The train named laughter
The train named laughter that runs
South of the border
Through the lonely hearts quarter
To a little bar they call the Happy Sun
Where even lifetime losers
And beautiful bruisers
And girls with a grudge can have fun

And it's flying off the tracks
It's keeping with the times
It's love em and leave em
It's one hell of a crime
When you learn too late
You're on the devil's blind date
With no one left to blame but your self

(Bridge)

And it's a read em and weep
It's awake from your sleep 
It's kiss your candy-ass goodbye
But while we're all falling
And the good Lord is calling
Don't waste your voice trying to cry
On the train named laughter

The train named laughter
On the train named laughter that runs
South of the border
Through the lonely hearts quarter
To a little bar they call the Happy Sun
Where even lifetime losers
And beautiful bruisers
And girls with a grudge 
You know they don't ask for much
Girls with a grudge
You know theyre happy to touch
Girls with a grudge
You know they like it rough
Where even girls with a grudge can have fun






Red Meteorite

Crashing through my wall
Stray satellite
May have heard the devil whisper in my ear
Caught in the wind
Caught in my mind
Caught in the crossroads of indecision
Lacking volition
Can't pull my eye from a rusty nail

Heaven or hell
It's so hard to tell 
When both make you kneel
And carry a seal
Some say it's just a dream
But it all just seems
So damned real

So I put a helmet on
Hit the wall hard
Please remind me not to try that stunt again
Caught in the wind
Caught in my mind
Caught in the atmosphere of an era
"God I miss you Sarah"
Can't free my mind from the way she used to smell

Heaven or hell
It's so hard to tell
When both make you kneel
And carry a seal
Some say it's just a dream
But it all just seems
Too unbelievable

Crashing through my wall
Red meteorite
May have heard the good Lord whisper in my ear





Blackbird 

If you see the screaming cock 
Tell him about this hen 
I just met her a minute ago 
She said she was looking for him 
I told her, friend, honestly, 
We all fit his description 
Whereupon she bit me in the balls 
Then had a grand conniption 
And if you meet the laughing duck 
Shoot him in the beak 
O it wont kill the stupid fuck 
But it just might make him meek 
I never did like loud birds 
Especially if they cant fly 
Let him lie there for awhile 
Dont tell him he wont die 
The mad rooster hes the worst of all 
With his morning cry for sex 
Can a rooster fly, I dont even know 
But he sounds just like his ex 
So if you brand him with an iron 
Or strike him with your fist 
Tell him he must be quiet now 
For his kind are never missed 
But in my mind theres another bird 
Beautiful, black, immense 
Driven by my dream for her 
Shes rising above the fence 
And your chicken-wire cant hold her man 
Shes got some place to go 
Out of this cage with a howl of rage 
Over the field of crow 
Can you see her mister? 
Can you hear her maam?
If you respond like you did before 
Im not sure that you can 
And Ive lived in your barnyard, babe 
Its a clich but it works 
Me to death, now all thats left 
Is a vision of this bird 
Shes just a dream, but very soon 
The flame will reach the hay 
Laughing like dynamite 
Bitch, Im going away 
And dont say 'he's flown the coop'
Say 'he burned down the bloody nest'
Blackbird opens up for me 
Were free and flying west 






Texas Solitaire

Ghost town, red guitar, girl I don't know where you are
But youre haunting me like a memory I can't seem to place
Or maybe it's the thought of God that's left without a trace

Now the mountains are on fire
And the rivers overflow
Though all that's in my heart
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
The valley is as dark as death
It buries everyone
And my worlds grown strangely silent
Since you've gone

Happy hour, cactus bar, broken jukebox, old lone star
Winks at me through an open roof or stares off into space
And it's the thought of you, my one true-blue, that sets my soul ablaze

Now the mountains are on fire
And the rivers overflow
Though all that's in my heart
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
The valley is as dark as death
It buries everyone
And my worlds grown strangely silent
Since you've gone

Lightning flash across the sky, my mind no longer answers why
Which I know is a source of hope, then on my lips the familiar taste
Of my girl touching this world with God's saving grace

Still the mountains are on fire
And the rivers overflow
Though all that's in my heart
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
Now the valley is as light as life
Shining like a psalm
After our worlds of woe -
Brave new dawn






The One That Got Away

Standing on a corner in Los Angeles
A sad boy, hes singing the blues
Because hes too young
For the song to be sung
And he doesnt know what else to do

When the woman who reflected all others
Walked into his poor, shabby life
He played it cool
Like a damned fool
Thats why hell never call her his wife

I was a cowboy in waiting
She was 7 wonders away
So when we met that day in December
I must admit I had nothing to say
So instead of being the queen of my heavenly dreams
Shes just the one that I let get away
Just a girl that I let get away

Her eyes were like the Mona Lisa's
Her body a lush Elysian field
But I was a child
I bit too modest and mild
I said, You cant let her know how you feel

Now theres heartache in knowing too little
Theres heartache in knowing too much
Theres money to spend
And cattle to tend
And a girl far away I cant touch

I was a cowboy in waiting
She was 7 wonders away
So when she left that day in December
I must admit I had nothing to say
So instead of being the queen of my heavenly dreams
Shes just the one that I let get away
The girl Im still thinking of today






Coma Love Song
(The Cost of Loving Badly) 

Met her in a letter that she sent me from the prison
She wasn't living very well at that time
O her temper didn't help her, it was awful, you should have seen it
She'd hit people in the face, that was her crime
But if I could get my hands on that pretty, angry girl
I'm sure that my sweet love would set her free
So I said it in a letter, "I think you can do better!
Shoot for good behavior and marry me!"

My beautiful bad girl, won't you marry me? 

They said it happened quickly, she turned upon a guard
And threw an inmates cards to the floor
Then screamed just like a queen who can't control her spleen
'Does that crazy bitch think I'm his whore?'
But if I could get my hands on that pretty, angry girl
I'm sure that my sweet love would set her free
So I went down to the prison, "Darling you're forgiven,
Forsake your foolish fears and marry me!"

My beautiful bad girl, won't you marry me? 

Can't say it was pleasant when I woke up from the coma
With a broken jaw and a broken soul
But the nurse standing above me was smiling and lovely
"Florence Nightingale, will you marry me?"

(Bridge)

My beautiful bright girl, won't you marry me?

Well she must have pulled the plug because I can feel the bugs
Crawling under my skin into my blood
Now it doesn't seem so funny, the bitter taste of honey
The suicide performed in the name of love
And if this is heaven, what happened to my brethren?
And who are all these shadows on the wall
Saying, 'come with us,' and, 'haven't you had enough?
Did our beautiful bad boy enjoy his fall?'

(Female voices echo last line) 
Did our beautiful bad boy enjoy his fall?

Now I can see no use to reach out for the noose
Or to cry in the name of God, "I curse you all!"






In Memory of Her 

angry 
Im so angry at the world 
because I couldnt save her 
from being taken like a child 
swallowed by a twister 
my lovely, little sister 
and I guess Im just angry at my self 
and this memory 
for me 
truly is a taste 
of the real 
eternal hell 
because there was a moment 
she was leaning towards the light 
yes, I took the time 
tried to say it right 
all those arguments 
why she should live, Lord, 
I did say it well 
and this memory 
for me 
truly is a taste 
of the real 
eternal hell 
but it was all bullshit 
everything I said 
thats not why she should of stayed 
she was the fucking light in this place 
I should of closed my mouth 
and put my arms around her (like Jesus) 
to show her what I mean instead 
as I said 
girl, youre heading for a fall 
she fell 
she fell 
the words were still on my lips 
and this memory 
for me 
truly is a taste 
of the real 
eternal hell 
they say it wouldnt of made a difference 
they say it wouldnt of made a difference 
they say I couldnt of made the difference 
anyway, of course theyre right 
nobodys to blame 
at all 






Lve Sol

Theres a touch that defies the wisdom that youve learned
Yes, there's a touch that defies the wisdom that youve learned
A pang that seizes in the night, and it burns o how it burns
Theres a map in your hand and a direction you cant speak
Yeah, theres a map in your hand and a direction you cant speak
And when you try to tell her of it, you know it makes you weak
Then I spotted Tanto, Tanto said, No Im not he!
Thought I spotted Tanto, Tanto said, Man, Im not he!
If the wilderness has disappeared, how the hell can we break free?
Once I met a girl, way too young and far too pretty
One night I met a girl, she was way too young and far too pretty
So I kissed her on the cheek goodbye and thought, Damn what a pity!
Im heading back to Cali now, but I may just land in Texas
Yes, Im going back to Cali now, but Ill probably stop in Texas
All because the old man swore, You know Austin is the Nexus!
This song might make some sense to you, but then again I doubt it
This song might make no sense to you, but then again I doubt it
But if you know the truth by now, I pray to God that you wont shout it
That was not the line to end on, yet I will end it anyway
That was the perfect line to end on, yet I could end another way
With so much love in my soul tonight, theres nothing left to say





 
Sam's Song

So if we should meet back in Philly 
Or if we should die on the way
Well thats not their problem
Or something were solving
Its not touching our souls, not today
Yes you are special, so pretty and pure
I know you could do better than me
They say, "youre wasting your talent
That man will never be valiant
All I say is, 'I guess we will see
So hold me like I was a winner
Kiss me cuz Im on my way out
They say, Life is a dollar
And that dog needs a collar
But sister I still have my doubts
So if I should rise like a Raptor
Or if you should sting like a Ray
They may call us two killers
But I have hold of both pillars
Theyre not taking us down, not today
 





I'm Right Here

If you find your way around the slump
The bump in the road, the holy lump
Lift your head up in the air

I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there

Only music can bind the time we've lost
With a bow or a rose or a sacred cross
The pain is not yours, it's ours to share

I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there

Though you feel so far from home
Know tonight you're not alone
And dare to ask, "if neither of us
Built this world, why not let it bust?"
Then in the break of current affairs

I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there

But if it seems like galaxies
Separate your prayer from me
The promise of God has come to pass
Just laugh, my love, let's laugh

Then with our eyes set on a star
Or dancing till all distance is near
God is love, no need to fear

He's right here, He's right here, He's right here
Im right here, Im right here, Im right here
Were right here, so right here, were right here





 
Darkness

toothless, topless lady lover
sweet Lily of my mind
strumming tunes from ancient days
the Nile or the Rhine
rolling out the times gone by
or the times yet to come

blind to all these thoughts of death
tonight the world is one

warlords on their battlefields
hungry for the call
cry out silently for blood
'every one of you will fall'
then scrolls of gallant knights unfurl
despite the naked drum

blind to all these thoughts of death
tonight the world is one

except, the distance, pulsing black
and breaking out with force
like a hit that comes too late
and then slays the ideal forest
'yes flames arise, set and sail'
while the native children run

blind to all these thoughts of death
or else hateful of everyone






Mealy-Mouth Martyrs

Take me to the mountain
Gonna meet the Mona Lisa
Gonna laugh a lot with her
And afterwards eat Pizza
Gonna talk about how history
Is written by such fools
'They might have a lot of money
But they have too many rules'
And I don't like their politics
And I don't like their state
But I like you a lot my love
Let's go swim in the lake

And I don't think I'm alone
In wanting to break this wall of stone
But I doubt I'll have too many friends
Once I tell the truth to them,
'You're all a bunch of fucking assholes!'

And if I am a liar
And if I am a cheat
At least I'm seeking clarity
With you now on the beach
And you may call my mister
Or you may call me Jack
But one thing is for certain sister
I won't be going back
So if you want to live 
Each day to the hilt
Take my loving hand, sweet Mona
We'll hit them where it hurts

And I don't think we're alone
In wanting to break this wall of stone
But I doubt we'll have too many friends
Once we tell the truth to them,
'You're all a bunch of fucking assholes!'

And dance with me
Come dance with me
And let's get married by the sea
Let's sing and sex
Let's sex and sing
Let's do damn near everything
Let's rock a busting boogie babe
Forget your family and your slaves
Set them free for they're sick of you
As I'm sick of everyone I knew

We'll be outcasts with smiling feet
And not once lose the beat
And walk those golden streets
(And meet Christ in person then)
No longer interpreted by men
"Some of you God loves very much"






Carolina Sea

She's as pretty as pretty can be
Met her on the Carolina Sea
Dancing a jig with a John named Joe
The boy couldn't dance but boy could he row

O how I loved that girl

But then I forgot, went out alone
Stepped off the boat, sank like a stone
Drowned that night without a decent name
Now all they say is "ain't it a shame and

O how he loved that girl"

Today I'm different than I was before
Walk through walls like they are doors
A ghost, I guess, with flesh and breath
Now I'll be thankful for that second death

O how I loved that girl

Learned once that love is 
Learned once that love is 
Learned once that love is all you need
In the whole wide world






Brave Gentle

growling at passersby 
in the subway
because I don't have anything better to do
'O, I'm so sorry!' I say 
to myself, afterwards, in the night --
but what does it matter?
I ask myself, now 
on my knees
when finding forgiveness
is like entering through the eye of a needle

still in my mind's eye I see
happy nations dancing free
and a girl holding a flower
beneath falling towers
o Lord, make me like one of these gentle people

'to hell with you!'
the cry rings out --
"did I really say that?" and if so
"who to?"
It's like walking a prison
naked and frozen
or working in a profession
you know was never meant for you
so tonight I stop by
that old idiot steeple

still as my heart cries I see
loving families laughing free
and a girl holding a flower
beneath falling towers
o Lord, make me like one of these gentle people

but do you pray in truth?
or is it for an audience?
"vanity of vanities," the Preacher man says,
etc., etc.
no need to finish the stanza
unless you're speaking from or for...
don't ask why or when 
or where is it?
once again the old barbed-wire wall
makes all my attempts seem so feeble

still in the sky I prophecy 
a Golden Eagle flying free
and a girl holding a flower
beneath falling towers
o Lord, make me like one of these brave, gentle people






Dear Sophia

Once, if I remember well
My life was like a faery tale
I was wealthy, I was blessed
By the body of a princess
But I took too much for myself
Then my wings began to melt
Beneath the crush of the swirling dawn

O dear Sophia, where have you gone?

The ambassador in Tine-man Square
Swears that he has seen you there
Dancing for an Egyptian lord
Waving your skirt and a sword
As if wondering who to kiss or who to kill
Before receding into the night just like a swan

O dear Sophia, where have you gone?

Maybe it's your gypsy blood
Or your thirst for the dark gods
That drove you far from my door
Onto the steps of a foreign shore 
Forced you to play these diverse parts
From Isis to Gandhi, even Genghis Khan

O dear Sophia, where have you gone?

And if we should meet again somehow
After you've slain the sacred cow
Remember nothing in this world is free
Not even the memory of our marriage bed
Where we fought and loved and on occasion bled
Then forgive me for dragging out these old dry bones

O dear Sophia, where have you gone?

As I forgive you for all the crazy shit youve done
You damned fool Sophia, come on home!






Everything about Her Makes Me Laugh

I see here there with long black hair
she's a child then so free from sin
and her mother sees her father in the way she says 'hello'
and her father sees her mother in the way she needs to know
everything, so everything, yes everything
about her makes me laugh

later then, I met her when
alone I stood like a piece of wood
wanting more from my God of signs
saying jokingly, "call me some time"
now everything, o everything, simply everything
about her makes me laugh

and our Father sees His Spirit in the way she's dancing now
and the Spirit shows off the Son in the way that I know how
to laugh or sing or dance or fly, gently or on fire
lets make love forever as the music takes us higher

born to us, a daughter Joy
need I tell you, she's perfect too
with eyes like lights of paradise
and hair as black as the purest night
we spend our days watching her grow
and like her mother she needs to know

everything, so everything, yes everything
about her makes us laugh






Born to Win

I was born to win 
No matter what you say
Gonna rise from the dead
And take heaven today
Gonna kiss the earth
Gonna work the soil
Gonna break the yoke
Gonna take the spoil 
Gonna rob from the rich
And give to the poor
You don't like that senator
Let me tell you what's more
Gonna let your sweet oil
Sprinkle my land

Welcome dear world the new American

When I see a man 
Looking down and out
Unable to laugh
Unwilling to shout
Crippled by the blow
Of democracy
Where money is god
And nobody is free
Or everyone is equal
So the big book reads
Unless, of course
You're not given to greed
But here to love your neighbor
And to make a stand

Welcome dear world the new American






The Sprinkling

I have been
But now Im back
You say, Where?
And I say, 'Yeah!'

I was just a speck
On a tiny stain
A bloody splotch
On the window pane

I became a man by letting go
Of myself for the Spirits flow
Now I soar, hear me sing
Laughing too, and wondering
About the clowns I left up there
Because Im on the soil
And thats Somewhere too beautiful
To view from a tailspin

So I hope you learn
You really learn to sit
Before you fly 
Before you flip

Because its so hard to keep your balance
When youre high like that
Consumed by all your talents 
And your plans

"The eye is the lamp of the body
If your eye is good, your whole body
Will be full of light
But if your eye is bad..."

I have been
But now Im back
You say, Where?
And I say, 'Yeah!'

I became a man by letting go
Of myself for the Spirits flow
Now I soar, hear me sing
Laughing too, and wondering
About the clowns I left up there
Because Im on the soil
And thats Somewhere too beautiful
To view from a tailspin






Death-Rattle Riddler

Dialectic, doubts raised on reason
The ceremonies that turn the seasons
Sex and drugs and rock n roll
And the bitter lie that slays the soul
Saying, you were born to live this low
As for her love, youll never know
Whether you will reach that height
Only to fall back into night

All these suicide devices
All these tools which feel real nice 
When theyre around
Are on the ground, and they're bleeding
On the fodder youd be feeding from tomorrow
But now its gone

Yesterday you were a loser
But tonight you turn and tell her
No Im not 
But what kind of proof have you got 
Besides all this hope? 
Could it be just a fantasy? 
Or something you know?
In what sense?

Your neck it is so tense, my son
And I do believe youre the only 
Whos ever been this pale
Youre bound to fail no matter what you do
And you dont even know whats true 
Or what is false
And wheres your pulse? 

So I listened to the Serpent
Speak these words that made me feel 
So dead and blue
But are they true? 
Regardless of the circumstance
There are just certain nights
When you cant dance alone

But what kind of weapon will it take
To finally break this face of stone?
Maybe a violin in the hands of a gypsy maiden 
Will be enough to take me home? 
Then again, maybe not

So wont you help me God?
Because Im locked in this cave
Poisoned by the thought
It doesnt matter what you pray!
Bound by hate and lust and doubt 
Having waited and willed all my life
Just to hear you say, in no uncertain terms:
My beloved child, come out! 






Down Clown

Dance like that she said and sang and whistled with a grin
And when I fell flat on my ass she laughed, lets try again
So I ran like hell to escape sad thoughts of that highway life
Straight into a synagogue where the Sheriff raised a knife
No, I cried, they did that to me in the beginning
Yes, he said most sternly, now we shall do it at the ending

O joker  yeah, you mister
Pleasure, panic, pain
This world was not meant for beauty
And the masters are insane

The mirror it stood so crookedly and another shook his head
I swear that is not my face, otherwise Im really dead
So I pulled it down, that damn clown, and the gun it fell with him
Barefoot I stood and prayed for blood, or else to be forgiven
After forty nights of fasting, not from food but only sleep 
I held my ear to the ceiling just to hear an angel weep

O joker  yeah, you mister
Pleasure, panic, pain
This world was not meant for beauty
And the masters are insane

But of course that's an overstatementit never got that ugly
So I arose, still frozen, and found a sad girl to say she loved me

O lover  yeah, you sister
Body, soul, sweet hand
Your heart was born for magic
And you know Im just the man






A Grief Observed
(Allegory of the Roman Calendar)

Its Halloween evening, the crickets are chirping
Not a soul in the house is asleep
So we go to the market, see a devil, a hornet
I decide to dress like a creep
And is it so wrong to make peace with the world
And your soul by wearing a mask?
Its been nearly six nights since their mother has died
Theres not a soul in the world I can ask
But the kids still love candy, despite the horror
Some things will always taste sweet
So we skip like a family, and eat enough for an army
Door to door down Saint Valentines Street
And is it so wrong to make peace with your soul
And the world by wearing a mask?
It took nearly all night to poke out each pumpkin light
But we knew that the fun could not last
And is it so wrong to make peace with the world
And your soul by wearing a mask?
All night in her sleep my daughter kept screaming:
Mommy, dont let em get dad!
All night in his sleep my son was heard weeping:
Daddy, the monsters are back!
Now its the night before Christmas, demons are howling
Not a soul in the house is asleep
So I yell to tell her, No, Im not dying daughter
Why dont you try counting sheep?
Truly Christmas is over, the season of lovers
As I drink the last drop from my flask
Im lying under the tree, Santas smiling at me
And I think about lighting this match, and ask 
Would it be wrong to stop singing these songs
To wake up and tear down this mask?
Its the Fourth of July, we watch angels fly by
I figure somebodyin one great act of 
Mercyforgot to turn off the gas

(Voluptuous Female Angel Voices Counterpointing)
Was it you, was it you, was it you
(My Final Protest)
It wasnt me!
(All Together)
Was it you, was it you little Jack?

(Repeat final refrain six more times with increasing intensity, volume, tragic pitch and Siren sweetness, followed by a singular Hallelujah chorus intoned in pure spirit)






We Have Gone

You have gone the way of pleasure
You have gone the way of pain
You say, yes you say
"We have gone the way"
She has gone the way of glory
With a ribbon in her hair
He has gone the way of violence
Cutting the ribbon she did wear
Before she hid herself in shame
So we say, o no, we say
"She has gone away"
While he rises to new fame
Yes we all know his name
Yet for that, he's only rich and vain
"No one's to blame
But the bastard's here to stay"
If we are wise, we will walk away






Make It Back
(The Sweetest Vibe)

If you try to make it all the way back
You might get hungry or you might get trapped
But we are not children  this much I know
It really doesnt matter which way we go
So if you lose hold on all of these facts

By God, dear lady, we just might make it back

And I see, theres a Rose, a simple symbol, if it grows, like the blood on a prayer, so sanctified there, where the rivers all run, as they sing of the Sun, and the rhyme is not forced, by now, nor divorced, from the earth or this notion, then let us trust our emotion, for once, yes come, we can laugh it all underrolling thundertonight, chanting psalm ninety-five, it's the sweetest vibe

And if you cant make it by fog or by fire
Or when I tell you, my love, its not about our desire
Then turn a deaf ear  Im just in a mood
Sometimes you cant trust yourself, though you think that you should
But if you should lose your hold on these facts

By God, dear lady, we just might make it back






Until I Found You

You say you spend your nights in France
Teaching the young poets how to dance
You say you preach in the streets of Manila
Then return to Japan to defeat Godzilla

Me, Im out here in the blue
Wondering what in the world I should do
Since you left my heart like a hurricane
Perhaps for Jamaica, or else for Spain

Ive been to Sodom
Lost some time in Gomorrah 
Built myself a spaceship
And flew clear to tomorrow
Done about everything
One man can do
But I never knew love
Until I met you

You may right all the worlds wrongs
With the power of your sweet song
Follow a rainbow over the moon
Yes I believe you are that kind of girl

But even if you find the Golden Bough
Turn all magic into here and now
No treasure on earth would be enough
Compared to the pleasure of our love

Youve been to Paris
Youve been to Prague
Tripped the light fantastic
Through the London fog
Seen about everything 
One woman can see
But you never knew love
Until you met me

In the throes of your wildest flight
As you ventured your soul for the glory of night
Yes you slipped through the Tempests eye
And we crossed each other where the angels fly

Now we are blessed
And content to soar
Through the great and holy 
Sky of the Lord

So goodbye dear Sodom
Sayonara my sweet Gomorrah 
I once gave my heart to you
But today Ive found another

And our ships not going down 
As we dance across the stars of God
Not giving the devil or damnation
Even a wink of a thought






Elegy for Emily

Its hard to leave the Sun I say
And harder to fight the rope
That dangles and gently tickles me
With temptation to Know

Have you seen them coming, sister?
Dont fear, though Im gone
If they threaten you with gold, my lover
Simply strum your song

She walked and Fell and ran and
Through Needles Eye escaped
As an Eagle lost in human hope
Said shed rather be raped

O it was not a hard exile
She preferred the crusty Earth
When dwelling with that Sickly smell
He signified her worth

Red flies in droves and polite clowns
Then the shacklessilver, clanged
All the time she fought that tender noose
They killed her with a Bang

Can you see them leaving, sweetheart?
Dont fear then, theyve gone
And if I cover you with Roses, glory
Know youre worth every one






Cold War Hysteria
(Parked on the Beach)
And a Different Drummer

Old man, old dog
Park on the beach
Bleach-blond, napalm
The sun sets to teach

Lady, I love
Her mind's bent on burning
My friend, in the sky
What are we learning?

Anyway that song's been sung
Anyone seen the Risen One?
Anyway the day is done
Anyone seen tomorrow's Dawn?
Because I'm anxious to kiss it
Afraid that I missed it

Whistling one, my darling dove
Waits on the deck
As I look down from this shuttle
Our life's but a speck

Anyway that ship has fallen
Somewhere in space it hit a wall an'
Slip, stutter-stutter skip
US-STALIN fallin' down
To the sound of feet
Pounding against the bloody earth
US-STALIN fallen down
To the sound of feet
Pounding against the bloody earth

Anyway that song's been sung
Anyone seen the Risen One?
Anyway the day is done
Anyone seen tomorrow's Dawn?
Because I'm anxious to kiss it
Afraid that I missed it

The lifeguard shouts: Watch out for
A green heart with wings, drumming
And someone will be strumming, softly"
Who could that be?

Over there, beyond the sighs and screams
The seas lit up just like that mystic dream
Buried deep beneath the growls and groans
I hear her say, Some strange seeds been sown

Coming to our own
Everything infused with breath
Then we leave the rest to rot
It wasnt a lot anyway
Hello darling day
Hello!






Musical Note

With a note you can quote the Man in the golden coat
Who sings and brings good cheer with His song
Hes a Poet and a Priest, wiser than the least
Of these who walk among us but do not
Praise God with their voices or their personalities
The Spirit of the music speaks so tenderly
I thank God that I heard it, and now I sing along
With a note you can quote from His song
So Im singing for the ones lost and in between
The grayness of this ghetto, the greenness of the stream
That runs through the paradise of our company
With a note you can join Him and me
Lets go dancing in the park, climb the holy mount
Lets escape into the desert, drink from the eternal fount
That overflows the mirage, though Im standing in the garage
And the fumes from the machine make me sick
But with the radio on, I swim with the silver swan
And the melody of heaven on earth






Leaving You Here

I have gotten better girl, but you have gotten worse
I look like a Porsche now, and you look like a hearse
When we met on the other side, where everything is dark
I told you Id pull you out of here, then I kissed your bleeding heart
Well I followed through, you know its true, with everything I said
But walking hand and hand with you is like trying to raise the dead
And Ive got no more time left for wasting or for tears

So Im leaving you, yeah Im leaving you
And Im leaving you here

You may think Ive grown cold, despite all that youve done
Are you talking about your knife in my back, or simply about the gun
I dont know how you view the world, Ive been trying to figure out
Though Im standing on the other shore, and the bridge is broken now
Just let me say before I go, youre a bloody, stupid girl
For turning your back on the love we had, to save your little world
The one you built for yourself, out of hate and drugs and fear

So Im leaving you, yes Im leaving you
And Im leaving you here

If you happen to remember me, in your thoughts or in a dream
Or when youre doing that terrible thing you do to pass the time
I dont expect you to think of me as some kind of prince
Ive done my share of damage, I know, and a lot of other shit
But you cant accuse me of not caring, in fact I cared too much
While you were waging war on me, I was trying to make love
So before I say another word, I hope youre looking in the mirror

Because Im leaving you, yeah Im leaving you
And Im leaving you here
Im leaving you, yes Im leaving you
And Im leaving you here
Yeah Im leaving town, and Im leaving now
Girl Im out of here






Kingdom Come

Theres beauty in your wisdom
And magic in your touch
I didnt know how much you loved me
But its so good to be loved
I was lost out in the world
Where many go astray
Forgetting their way home
And what it means to pray
Now with you by my side
I know what must be done

Let your will prevail on earth, Lord
Then let your kingdom come

Holy hallelujah
We praise you Lord Most High
Youre the majesty of the mountains
The glory of the sky
Youre the mystery of the ocean
The only one worthy of praise
So we cast our crowns before you 
O Ancient of Days
Now with you in our hearts
We do what must be done

Let your will prevail on earth, Lord
Then let your kingdom come 






Dantes Insight

Thats the revelation, thats the grace and form
Thats the sweetest vision and a shelter from the storm
She said her name was Sarah, and I didnt question her
When she said she knew me in her soul before I said a word
So I took her to the mountains and then down to the sea
Then the Holy Ghost fell upon us both and set our spirits free

Hey, hey, hey
What do you have to say?
Theres nowhere else in the whole wide world
But here with me today

So, I said, dear lady that makes you my bride!
Not, she laughed, if I should ride out on the tide!
So I held her like a mantra, and wouldnt let her go
And that was just the trick, which set her heart aglow
Then she pulled me under, and I didnt dare resist
Finally we sealed our death with a deep-sea drowning kiss

O, o, o
Where do you want to go?
Theres an eternity of things to see 
For those now in the know






Shock of Recognition

Its neither here nor there, its not one way or another
Its not your mother or your father or your sister or your brother
Its not something you can fathom or forgetfulness of sins
But when the good Lord makes his entrance
Youll know him, yeah, youll know him

One man climbs a mountain, another million dig a pit
There are gypsies, virgins, whores, and chiefs, but none of them are it
Way off in the wilderness, a gentle, holy wind
But when the good Lord makes his entrance
Youll know him, yeah, youll know him

So I learned after so much pain, so much pleasure and abuse
Theres a way to rise above it all, and thereby never lose
As for that touch of grace, only lowliness can win
But when the good Lord makes his entrance
Youll know him, yeah, youll know him 

I never humbled myself in truth, especially when I tried
The religious disposition is just the cornerstone of pride
Once I blundered badly, then I nearly cracked a grin:
My God, he walked among us, and we crucified him!






A Prayer for Bankruptcy 

He is a monarch
She is as well
While Im just a moth
On an old, window sill
Dusty from thought
It doesnt do any good
Like Solomon said
Dont bow down to wood

So if you know to know and so love
Or if you love enough on your way
Theres only one person to thank 
And how
But nobody left here to pay
Let us pray for the dawn of that day

Isnt it funny?
When it comes down to money
You just dont have anything left
This nations in deficit! 
So to be equal with that
Im not going to worry about it

Then you pull back
And think about whats been said
On the wall that stands in our town
Where deep underground
The dead bury the dead
Until the day were no longer around

So if you know to know and so love
Or if you love enough on your way
Theres only one person to thank 
And how
But nobody left here to pay
Let us pray for the dawn of that day

You are that monarch
And you are that moth
I was hardly alive
As a man of the cloth
They paid me in dollars
I paid them in souls
Though I was the one
For whom the bell tolls

But I didnt know and so hated
Crawling down an evil mans way
There was only one person to curse
And I praised him
Im not thanking that devil today
Come darkness and take him away

Tag:
Tiger of God, rise to your prey






Mississippi Homesick Blues

Came all the way up here from Mississippi
Mississippi my love hasnt left my mind
You know its hard finding a job in the city
These days trouble is the only thing I find
Sweating through these songs at the clubs
Yes Im sweating blood and the big city blues
Lord, if I dont find a girl soon in this city
I tell you I dont know what Im going to do

Because Ive got nothing to my name but my name
And Ive got holes on both my walking shoes
And Im lonelier than any man has ever been
Singing the lowdown Mississippi homesick blues 

Maybe come tomorrow my luck will turn  
Money will fall from the sky with my love
But I tell you today Im not holding my breath 
Because Ive never had anything but bad luck
So Johnny on the drums - keep the beat bright
Billy on the bass you do the same
Sister, sing with me like we are one in kind
Help me remember why it is I came

Because Ive got nothing to my name but my dirty old name
And Ive got holes on both my blue suede dancing shoes
And Im lonelier than any man has any business being
Just singing the lowdown Mississippi homesick blues 

Singing the lowdown Mississippi homesick blues
O there aint no cure, so I keep it pure
There aint no cure, Im pretty sure
For these lowdown Mississippi homesick blues
The only news is heart breaking news
The lowdown Mississippi homesick blues






Its Gotta Be a Sin
(Until Love without End)

Hey baby doll
I don't think we will fall
But I've been wrong before
About hate and love and war
Just hanging by a thread     
Remembering what you said
About this being the end
Still I'm sleeping in your bed

Now I'm not a religious man
I help people if I can                 
But then you cut me once again

Baby, it's gotta be a sin               

When I give you all I got
Granted, it's not a lot
Only to hear you say
"But I have bills to pay"
And it's taxing my very soul
To hear you tell me what I owe
And how you still love him
While you're sleeping in my bed

Now I'm not the most moral man 
True, I take it where I can
Because you're lying to me again

Baby, it's gotta be a sin               

So this time don't look back
I have a lover in the sack
Who means it when she says
Love is not a game or bet
Or something you have to win
Just fall into my arms
She's not worthy of you man
Let her go and let this be

A love free from sin

So I let you go and let this be
A love that knows no end
Amen






Born to Be Born

Baby, I wanted you but you
Were so far away and bound
By your world of bows and ribbons
By the wise with their golden crowns
But baby Im not wearing any crown
Not of laurel nor of thorns

Im just standing here with the ones
Who sometimes wish they were never born

So laugh at us and curse us
Call us the outcasts, the sick, or poor
But that is not the last word honey
I could say much more
But if I must endure my own reproach
Then bring on your so-called sacred scorn

As I stand here with the ones
Who sometimes wonder why they were born

For looking out in disrepute
The sullen gray smoke of dawn
I mean the way the voices of angels
Refuse to rise with our rebel song
And so desperate we could say
Christ when will it be our turn?

To which he says, Blessed are you of all
The ones who must be reborn

So in the thunder of reprieve
Our rest from worldly sorrow
Theres no thought of yesterday
Much less of tomorrow
As we taste the last of darkness
Now knowing it is morn

In the wings of the one who flies so high
And calls his children from the storm 

All of this was so youd hear my voice
And hearing, be reborn 






God and the Girl

She said that she knew me deeply 
Before I ever came to be
A presence in her life
And her eternity
When she touched me within
I felt myself breaking out
Of a world of fear, sorrow, and shame
Ugliness and doubt

Now Im happier than sunshine
Cooler than the fog
That shelters the weary people
From the wrath of a vengeful god
For the Lord of heaven
Is looking upon us both
And I know hell be with us
Wherever we may go

Bridge:
So I told her that I loved her
It was the first time in my life
I ever spoke the words
As I asked her
As I kissed her
As I asked that woman to be my wife

I said, I knew you deeply
Before I ever spoke your name
It was written in my soul
I can still feel the flame
And if I should ever lose her - 
An impossibility
Since her and God are dancing
In everything I see

Now Im happier than sunshine
Cooler than the breeze
That rises off the ocean
And makes music in the trees
For the Lord of heaven
Is looking upon us both
And I know hell be with us
Wherever we may go






Lady Sing

Lady sang the blues with ease
So pretty, sassy, silly, please
Keep the rhythm
The way you keep the rhythm interesting
As the trumpet croons, she kisses the moon
Just listen to that lovely lady sing
So if you happen to be strolling
Down the avenue of broken dreams
And her melancholy music catches your ear
Dont be shy, simply drop on by
You wont believe the beauty that youll hear
O it will somehow soothe
These smoky basement Jazz club blues
Make you feel like youve left the world on silver wings
As the guitar rift, allows your mind to drift
Into the heaven of every word she sings
Just listen to that lovely lady sing
Yes, just let it take you, how can it break you?
Let your body sway and swing
To the tune of paradise coming soon
Just listen to this lovely lady sing






Reaching Me

There was music in the meadow 
A girl with flowers in her hair
But I passed by on the highway 
You know I didnt seem to care
When she called my name much later
In a Paris night life trance
She held out her hand to me
But I didnt know how to dance
With one so kind and graceful
With one so kind and pure
I left her, no I ran from her
Not wanting the simple cure

She was reaching in the night from fright
For just one soul that she could trust 
It seems to me - shes dancing wild on the sea
Like each and every one of us
Like each and every one of us

A childhood misgiving 
Comes to me through this mellow air
Breaking my sweet intoxication
Driving me to despair
For the love of a lifetime
Is nothing more than the love of now
Again I see her reaching out
Again I dont know how
The things that mean so little
Could grow so large and bold
In the crazy minds of children
Locked out in the cold

Reaching in the night from fright
For just one soul they can trust 
It seems to me  theyre lost on the sea
Like each and every one of us
Like each and every one of us

Still there is a silence
Few dare to comprehend
For it is deeper than the darkness
Of a soul that will not mend
And yet its not too far off
From any of us






Standing in the Forest 

nobody thought 
thats the problem I guess 
shed be the one 
to walk out 
like she did 
she made a scene 
yeah it was so ugly 
it was beautiful 
but you had to know 
someone would have the guts 
to silence you in time 
and shes standing in the forest 
trying to put to death 
all those things you taught her 
all the smart things you said 
since she was very young 
in your school, your lovely school 
but still shes not completely free 
for she hears what youd say here
and so cannot see the forest for the trees 
and back in the classroom 
though shes not there in spirit 
a hundred drowsy zombies 
pretend that they dont hear it 
this buzzing in your words 
or the song in their hearts 
yes she just said 
bury the dead 
and it was poetry in motion 
a case of God in love 
perfect art 
and shes standing in the forest 
trying to put to death 
all your fine observations 
all the witty things you said 
since she was very young 
now shes forgetting every one 
as she stares up at the stars 
a dim and dying voice stutters
no, no, the human eye cant see that far 
but she sees farther than you thought 
or did you ever think? 
its hard to say 
as the sun arrives just in time 
therell be no more lessons or complaints 
no, not today 






Lady Wonder Dame

light me like a fuse that winds down like a snake 
that leads back to the garden and then gets lost in the lake 
or screw me like a light bulb that was never meant to shine 
and if I laugh, 'hey come again!' just give me a hard time 
for happiness may slit your wrists and leave you awake and cruel 
or sorrow will surely break your balls and hand you the golden rule 
so take it as you like it or hate it until you can 

kiss me like you mean it my lady wonder thunder dame 

dancer of lost melodies, visions of the heart 
dont tell me where they come from or show me when to start 
cuz you can see I'm beautiful and you can see I'm bad 
tickle me till I'm Elmer Fudd or I'll spank you till your glad 
for these seasons speckled yellow, silver ribbons in your hair 
no you're not as pretty as you once were but darling I don't care 
because I've stopped pretending to be as wise as Everyman 

so just kiss me like you mean it my lady wonder thunder dame 

and if our children come out laughing that's no surprise at all 
or if our parents come out in them, we'll love them ten feet tall 
for there are no more lying rhymes left in the whole damned world 
call it sentimentality killed by science or call it nothing at all 
still there's poetry in silence if your life has turned to prayer 
and if you've met God in hell, I guess you know him everywhere 
so touch me one last time before we're forced to say 'amen' 

and kiss me like you love me and then kiss me once again 






Blood on the Blade

There was blood on this blade of grass
And for some reason that made me laugh
Loudly, now I was free
To touch the taste of death
The taste of death and greenery
Yes, my student, but what does it mean to thee?
Poetry, the seed, the shard
The temple built out of legs and lard
But how? What!  wow! -
Didn't you know teacher
All philosophy begins in wonder
And vague and nebulous are the beginning of all things
But not their end
And I would have you remember me as a beginning
And not as an end
I mean it's golden unseen glimmering
I mean it's green blood against a sanguine sun
On the rise tonight

Jerusalem
Jerusalem

So on this most peculiar night
I fight not to stay in tune
But rather struggle to put down
The sound of tomorrow's noon
Since I must sleep
Now that's there's work to do

And with a scab and in the cab
I clap my hands
With a scab and in the cab
I clap my hands
With a scab and in the cab 
I clap my hands
And pay the man what's due -
"Thank you"

Then I turn real slow and go walking through
I turn real slow and go walking through
Yes I turn real slow and go walking through
Fields of AM... Fields of amber blue
I turn real slow and go walking through
Neon fields of amber blue
To find, to finally find my way
To find, to finally find my way
To find, to finally find my way
Back home






Jerusalem

She is beautiful 
That much is true
She is beautiful 
That much is true
She is beautiful
That much is true tonight
Though the world is warring madly
Our money, down the drain
And there is no reason to believe
We've ever loved except in vain
My hand is twitching terribly
My lips have turned bright blue
I'm standing on a precipice
And I don't know what to do
But she is beautiful 
That much is true 
She is beautiful 
That much is true
She is beautiful 
That much is true tonight
Though dreams hit like a hammer
Break my skull and bleed my heart
And the girl who I thought would end my woe
Has left me for a shark
I feel no need to clamor
Or complain about my fears
Nor risk annihilation
By asking, "Is God even here?"
For all of that and all of this
And for all I cannot speak
I dare this much
The human touch
Because she is beautiful to me
Yeah she is beautiful all dressed in black
She is beautiful in white
Naked or on fire
My love is beautiful tonight






The Last Words of a Wire Walker

Girl you are so pretty, pretty as can be
And when I think of you, I know you think of me
As I walk the tight rope, over this ghost town
I hear your voice, even though, theres no one around
And it makes me feel so happy, so carefree and so strong
Like I was  as I am  fifty feet above the ground
And we were dancing yesterday, dancing on the moon
I didnt like the lyrics, but I sure liked the tune
And the way my body felt, pressed against your gown
Then the moon turned red, and your heart began to pound
And it made me feel so happy, so carefree and so strong
Like I was  just then  a billion light years above the ground
So if I cross this wire, and make it back to you
I can think of a thousand things you and I could do
Like go have a picnic, beneath the cherry tree
Sipping whisky sours and loving tenderly
And Ill make you feel so happy, so carefree and so strong
Ahhhhh shit! Watch out below! Ahhh I guess I-I-I was wroonng!!!!
Love never looked so crazy, falling to the ground
  





Murky Midnight Runner

He was blind but he was running
Running but he was blind
Across the schools of deep death dying
Running wild and blind
A thousand sleepless visions
Spurred him on like they could be
Apprehended or suspended
'Lord God set me free!'
The cry rang out throughout the night
'It's too cold and it's too hot!'
Now the man was suffocating
On the things our nation bought
'Like the declaration of independence'
He laughed one time at last
He was blind but he was running
He was dying so damned fast
 





The Fleshly Heart of Man

Watch me while I soar so high
On the moon or in the sky
Dancing like a sickle in full swing
Jesus Christ, He holds me well
And His words ring like a bell
In a soul now set ablaze by beauty
Duty, I know none but Him 
Never trust the crooked men
Who say they're building this or that for God
Not one of these stones will remain
Nor will their water wash the stain
Left for the children they so soon forsook

And while I sing my songs
They quote a book
Daggers in the fleshly heart of God

The weight of my body's heavy enough
To crush the ashes of his bluff
"The Lord rebuke you Satan!" and it's done
Son of Man crucified
"Why have you forsaken me?" he cried
Now let your life be an answer to that question
But please my friends not another lesson
For that only leads to more aggression
From the heavy handed marionette
'All aboard now' and  'place your bets'
Just then the pillars of the palace shook 

And while I sing my songs
They quote a book
Daggers in the fleshly heart of God

So sit or stand according to
What you want or what you do
The Red Horizon's one thing that won't lie
Then die the death of the martyrs' crown
"You alone Lord deserve renown
We have made a bloody mess of the whole damned thing!"
Singing songs we never felt
Memories of the marriage belt
Texas buckle or the silver star
Still we say, 'We wonder who you are
And exactly how are we supposed to look?'

And while I sing my songs
They quote a book
Daggers in the fleshly heart
They're daggers in the fleshly heart
Just daggers in the fleshly heart of Man
  





White Night 

He said the blank page reminded him 
of a virgin spun in silk. 
The mountains explode with love and rockets, 
she cried. 
Because that is how it felt. 
On the high-beam her body bent
and swung and flipped and twirled: 
she landed flat on her feet 
Perfect, I laughed, my lovely girl! 
Now love is not a game, I know, life is not a race 
And though Ive heard the word misused, tonight I feel her grace 
Cuz faith is not a figment, no, still words do not suffice 
Like fingers they point to a place, where our dreams become our life 
I said, lover, trust me just this onceand youll be just finetonight 
And when we were together 
on the roof of the ivy house, 
the sun hid us from the night before -
she undid her blouse
and said, 
Please don't take this, mister,
as a come-on or a threat,  
its just the sun, it feels so good, 
and Im so glad we met."
Now love is not a game, I know, life is not a race 
And though Ive heard the word misused, tonight I feel her grace 
Cuz faith is not a figment, no, still words do not suffice 
Like fingers they point to a place, where our dreams become our life 
I said, lover, trust me just this onceand youll be just finetonight 
So on our horsesblack and white 
her and Irespectively 
travel like two pilgrims, 
then plunge into the sea. 
Laughters not a science, no. 
Hey, what do you mean by that? 
Dont say a word, is all I heard
before everything went black. 
(And there was nothing left to ask.) 
Now love is not a game, I know, life is not a race 
And though Ive heard the word misused, tonight I feel her grace 
Cuz faith is not a figment, no, still words do not suffice 
Like fingers they point to a place, where our dreams become our life 
She said, lover, trust me just this onceand youll be just finetonight 
I laughed, I guess were friends? 
again, everything wentWhite 






Flannery O'Connor's Offspring

"Every once in awhile"
She said with a smile
"I meet someone I can stand
But other than that
It's just me and the cat
And it's not easy to understand
This desire I feel 
To reach out and touch
Someone who really cares
But like I said
I sleep alone in this bed
With these beads and my teddy bear"

Sweet, sweet despair
Sweet, sweet despair

Meanwhile he laughed
Taking a nap
"Thank God for the grim reaper"
But then he awoke
An everyday bloke
"I was better off as a sleeper
And if I should pass
Where the grass meets the tracks
Or where starboard meets the stairs
Would I still be dead
And stuck in my head
Or will I find Him over there?"

Sweet, sweet despair
Sweet, sweet despair

So winter had set
Like a trap from above
Gray thoughts and heated halls
Then she stepped out
At the same time as him
And they met up at the mall
'Love at first sight'
The idiots say
'Kiss me darling if you dare'
But what if the two
Should come together as one
O Lord hear their prayer

Sweet, sweet despair
Sweet, sweet despair

Blessed are you my children
Yes, blessed are you my children
Enter here






Sailing to Zion

Tired of the fuss and fret
Tired of the fear
People running around like fools
Never any music here

So someday soon
And it won't be long
Someday soon 
And it won't be long
Someday soon 
And it won't be long
Gonna sail away to Zion

Some say it's a symbol
Some say it's a place
Me, I say it's a state of mind
Where we can live free from hate

So someday soon
And it won't be long
Someday soon 
And it won't be long
Someday soon 
And it won't be long
Gonna sail away to Zion

Don't need a ticket to go there
Don't need money or a key
All you need is love for your neighbor
And even for your enemy

So someday soon
And it won't be long
Someday soon 
And it won't be long
Someday soon 
And it won't be long
Gonna sail away to Zion






Skeleton Key 
(The Human Disease)

Come and let's discover the sorrow of beauty
The blindside of loving at the root of all things
Like death in a boxcar, sparks from a fallen star
The tears in your eyes, love, that you forgot to cry

So I cheered her with laughter
And went home right after
Crawling on my knees
Trying to find the key
The white and moonlit key
To unlock the human disease

Isn't it uncanny what we'll do for money
Yes it's quite unnerving, the way she tells me that she loves me
So I take her much too lightly, and she hardly ever sees me
Still we dance the night electric, pretending that we're godly

O hell fire deliver us
From this soggy generation
Nation of half-hearted
Half-witted and redundant
Crawling on their knees
Trying to find the key
The black and bloody key
To unlock the human disease

But if my hands were flames
That could shake the icy sea within
Perhaps I would have met him
The man I missed in Brussels
And laughed at in Manila
The soldier on my trophy rack
Waving an American flag and an AK-47
While the radio played in all these places -
"Just another brick in the wall"
So I see through the bloody sham
I drop my chin and understand
Then everything is dead to me
Because I am the man

There's silence in the passing of each and every life
Whether it be mother, sister, lover, friend or wife
Father or brother, daughter or son
I will howl after death until this damned thing is done

And my hands are wrapped around his neck
And my gun has broken both his knees
And I'll make that pale bitch swallow
His skeleton key






See Us

See me in the wind, my friend
See me on the wave
See me riding high and dry
Without a song to play

See me with a cigarette
See me with a girl
See me next time around
I will win the world

But see me with an axe to grind
See me red with shame
See me looking for my self
Locked outside my name

And if by chance you meet me there
In desolation, doubt, and chains
Take my hand because you're a better man
Lead me out of the rain

Then perhaps, you'll find a friend
Inspired to help another
With the same care you showed for him
Brother to brother to brother

So see me in the wind, my friend
See me on the wave
See me riding the sweet by and by
With a new song to play

See me with a holy heart
Heaven's precious pearl
See me dressed in the Father's love
Which heals this bloody world






Queen Beauty 

She was a looker from Davenport Manor
I was a sleepwalker from one crazy dream
But I dropped that old act
You know that's a fact

When her beauty came calling my name

"Brilliant," she laughed, "no more love songs
Rock me hard, forget fortune and fame"
What could I do?
Her voice pierced me through

When her beauty came calling my name

Dandies of doubt and depression
All you who love panic and pain
There's no use in describing
The medicine she's prescribing

Let her flush your old life down the drain
O Beauty, dear Beauty, my queen
