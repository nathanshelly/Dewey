Oh GOD!!

A young man lay motionless in the snow. His gray eyes reflected in the night as his red hair glowed. The white of the snow was diluted by his blood, staining it a fade of pink. His breath was visibly shallow, as the ice crystals formed around him. The lone street light, elaborated the beautiful horror.

I.I think Im dying.

He tried to focus with his eyes, they only thing still moving. His breathing quickened in fear of what was to come. He tried to force his eyes to stay open, but the darkness started to form. Motionless as he was, his gaze stared out in the black emptiness of the sky. The darkness he was experiencing was nothing compared to it. It slowly took over his eye sight, he could feel his heart pounding harder. It was pumping blood he knew would never run through his body again. A small smile formed on his lips, the blood just beginning to dry around them.

I guess this is it?

His vision gave out on him, nothing but darkness remained. His body started to go numb. The pain he once felt was gone, replaced with the comfort of deaths arms. His face relaxed, but his eyes still gazed up at the sky that he could no longer see.

II dont want to die.

His last breath left him, just another ghost of a final memory. The falling white did not let up, but the blood still shown through the newly formed snow. The mans gray eyes still open, starring forever into the darkness.

But whos?

******************************************************


A man looked down from the building he was standing on. The dark night hid his features. His eyes darted back and forth, as if looking for something. In the dark, a person was running. Locked on to his target he spoke.

Target required. What is your order? He spoke so stoically, no emotion lingered in that voice.
A small beep was heard near his ear. The voice was automated and barely understandable. What ever words were spoken, the man knew exactly what to do.

Understood. Commencing program.

Before his target could get away in running distance, the man just jumped off the building. 

The man fell with the gravity of speed, one no one would survive from. The windows reflected his down fall with a silent grace, as the ground kept speeding forward. His eyes still locked onto the target, whom still not knowing what fate lay ahead just beyond the corner.

The man finally hit the ground. Dust formed around him, as the impact made a crater near his feet. The pavement cracked with such force, that it screamed. The target stopped only meters away, shielding its body from the rocks and dust.
When the area began to clear, the target looked around. There, the man on the building stood. No sign of damage from the fall, just dust particles resting on his shoulder.
The said target, fell backwards to the ground, staring in disbelief.

Nono way The target stuttered, his green eyes wavered.
The man spoke again, voice in the same stoic manner.
Target is acquired. Permission to follow last orders.
The beep sounded again. The same voice followed, giving orders.
Affirmative.
The targets eyes widened. No!! Dont listen!! He reached out to the man before him. 
The man slung out a blade from his right arm. Moving his arm he slung it left, the blade grew longer, reaching the targets neck.

Blood flew everywhere, as the man swung the blade back in to his arm. The targets body slumped to the ground, and a few minutes later a dull thump was heard. The man looked down at the target. His decapitated body twitched.
Target, Eliminated.

Another ping chimed in his ear. The voice once again spoke, acknowledging his achievement. Giving the man a last order.

Understood. Returning to headquarters.

The man started walking. He walked over the body as if it were just some object to be thrown away. His shoes walked over the sticky red substance with quite easy. Bloody foot prints trailed behind him. The man stopped at a street light. Looking up into it. His features visibly seen. His red hair glowed in the light, as his gray eyes fixated on something that was never really there. Specks of wet blood, painted his face. He stood there, silently. He was seemingly talking to something else, then the dead body below. It didnt take long for the man to vanish in a blinding speed. Dust and leaves was the only thing disturbed.

Chapter Two
Father?
A tall man looked down at his son.
What is it?
The boy looked over at a the casket in front if him.
Is sister in that? He asked. Pointing towards the elegant floral painted death bed.
The man rested a hand on his sons red head. He didnt say anything, just a small smile.
The boy was confused. Why was his sister in the box. People told him she was in there, but he wanted to know why they couldnt see her. Why she wasnt there with them.
The boy looked around. These people he did not know, but the words that came out of their mouth.

What a horrible thing.
I heard they beat her face in.
What do you expect, from a man who let his daughter run around like that.

Gossip. Something that made the boys blood boil and he didnt even know what was going on. His anger subsided when he felt his father grab his hand. A small warmth was all he needed to know, that his sister was never coming back. A father and son bond, where silence meant more then words did. A slight squeeze of a hand was all that was needed, a sign that it was alright to cry and he did.

******************************************************

An shearing stab, but no blood. What is this?
Who are you?
My sharp breath. Yet I can not move.
Do you know me?		

******************************************************

The sound of machinery echoed throughout the building. A slight humming noise, coming from a closed door, held a light tune. The creaking sound as it opened, stopped the person in mid-hum. It was a sandy blond haired woman, in her early 30s. She gave a frustrated sigh as she adjusted her glasses with her free hand.
This door always needs fixing.
A small laugh turned her frustration else where.
You know Clare, doors dont talk back.
Clare frowned adjusting her white lab coat.
What are you doing here? I thought you had the day off.
The man yawned as he scratched his day old beard. His brown messy hair was a tell-tell sign he had just gotten up.

It was, but I got a call.
Clare snide. Really, what about then?
The man frowned. It has to do with the new modules we have out.
Clare sighed. You mean the 80 class. She leaned her body on the side of the wall.
The man nodded. He walked over to Clare, resting on the same wall.
Its only the assassination model this time around. The arm blade is stuck. The man pondered a bit. Must be because of all the blood that builds up every once in awhile.
He said it so nonchalantly, that Clare found amusement in it.
Clare laughed. Youre a sick one Will.
Will smiled. But Im not the one laughing, now am I, Clare.
Clare ceased her laughing abruptly. She looked away from Will.
Is is all right?
Will frowned at that question. No, its not alright. We have no choice in the matter anyways.
Will had had enough, he had to go work on his new toy anyways. He went up and started to leave. Clare stood there waiting. For what, she wasnt sure. Will stopped but didnt look back at her.
Clare, listen to me.
Clare did. She didnt want to miss anything.
If you even think about running, the organization will send an assassination model after you. All you have to do is grit and bare it.
Clare clenched her fist. Is, is that why they killed..!? 
Will punched the wall to stop her from speaking. Dont mention that name, let alone what happened, got it. Just do as I say and I promise
Will looked over at Clare and smiled. Just do as I say, Ok Clare.
Clare nodded. Will turned away again and walked through the double doors.

******************************************************

Will yawned again. His lab coat was crinkled, but he didnt care for the matter. He just grabbed a pack of cleaning tools and headed for another room. In the new room the walls lined up with numbers that where in 80-89. Will looked over at a sheet of paper and sighed. The maintenances was on a 80 model. He grumbled while he walked down the room.

Why couldnt be 11 or 66, 44 even, but why 88.

Will moodily brooded at a door with the numbers 88 plastered on it. He stood there for awhile, trying to figure out how to work with this one. Before he could even punch in the numbers, a small beep was heard. Will cringed out of irritation.
He let his hand drop from the numbering system and turned around.
There before him, was a little boy. A smile plastered on his face as bright as day.
Will looked down. What are you doing here 23? 
23 smiled and grabbed the mans hand. 88 isnt in there today. Hes already in the processing room.
Will laughed. Great, so your just sending me right to the beast.
23 smiled, all hyped up without a care. I do no know what you mean.
Will rolled his eyes. He still hadnt figured out why they gave 23 a childs persona, possibly bring a life in a thing not even living?
23 pushed open the door with ease, as he let go of Wills hand. The boy ran over to another man.
88, come look, come look. 23s attempts was useless, the redheaded man never responded.
23 crossed his arms and frowned. He started stomping his foot.
The only time you speak is when your on a mission.
Will sighed. 23 was already getting on his nerves, not to mention he had to work on the newest model available.
23, he works on command from the headquarters system. There should be no reason for him to talk to you.
Will started pulling out some cleaning tools.
88 just stared off in the distance. As 23 started bouncing off the walls.
NOOOOTTT true. He whined. 88 does take orders from me.
Will really would have wanted to kill the person responsible for making 23.
Yeah, but you also get your information from headquarters too.
23 stomped off, being bratty as usual. Your no fun. Slamming the door in the process.
Will secretly prayed if he had any children, they would not act like that. Then Will caught himself. 23 wasnt actually a boy, let alone a human.
He was getting a migraine, but at least one problem was gone. Will turned his attention back to 88. He walked over to him.

Number 88. Manual work number 108801. ID: William Henslin. Entry number 134.
88s gray eyes flashed, as his right arm extended. Will grabbed it carefully, as he turned the arm wrist side up. A tattoo of the number 88 was visibly seen.
I was told you had a dysfunction in your arm blade. Is that correct?
88 responded coldly. Chills went up Wills spine. That is correct.
Will hit a small button, masked as a freckle, that split the wrist open. There, neatly inside, laid a bloodied blade. Will pulled the blade out by hand and opened in. He could see why the arm blade didnt work, it was never bothered to be cleaned with. Even if the 80 models were new, maintenance was not well up there for standards as other models. Will cleaned the blade and retracted it back into 88s arm.
He sighed frustrated that he knew he would have to clean it again.
Why can they make the models maintain themselves?
The split closed up and 88 rested his arm down next to his side.
Order is clear and understandable. 88 will maintain program systems.
Will went white as a ghost. He had no idea that the 80 system was workable by command,  not only that but it was a simple suggestion to himself.
Will smiled. At least this was one job he didnt have to clean again.
Number 88. Manual work number 108801. ID: William Henslin. Exit number 431.
Will yawned again, looking forward to pack up and go home. Then he heard a ping. He sighed again and turned around.
Hello 23.
23 smiled. Is 88 ready?
Yes, he is ready. 23 grabbed Wills hand again, something Will was getting rather use to and walked back over to 88. 23 extended his hand to 88. 88 didnt even bother trying, all he did was start walking. 23 frowned and started pouting, squeezing Wills hand a little to tight.
Owwiee. Will complained. Whyd I punch that wall.
23 looked up, blinking. Owwiee?
Will smiled. Its nothing for you to worry about 23. Lets get 88 back. Then Ill put you ok.
23 was thrilled. Really.
23 started swinging his hand back and forth, Wills followed the same motion forcefully.
88 trailed ahead, glancing back momentarily at the two behind him. His red hair, hid his gray eyes. It reminded him of something. Of a man and a boy long ago. Something pulled him in that direction, but 88 kept walking. His gray eyes fixated on something that was never even there.

Chapter Three
Laughter erupted throughout the house as two siblings started to run around, lost in the emotion of fun. The boy ran after his much older sibling. He grabbed on to her dress, yelling happily.
Tag, your it. He let go of the dress, turning around the other way.
The girl smiled brightly as her red curly hair bounced with her every move.
You little monster, come here! Ill get you soon enough. She chided playfully.
She was ready to go after him when the door bell rang, stopping her movement abruptly. Her smile faltered into a frown, but switched back to a smile.
Saved by the bell. She glanced over at her little brother, who was knowingly hiding behind the curtains. His feet were a dead giveaway.
The girl walked over to the door and opened it slowly and pecked through the crack. There stood a man in dark colored clothing. She took a deep breath out of relief and opened the door a little wider.

Hello, Dr. Ackell. Its good to see you again. She smiled up at him.
Its good to see you too Sarah. Is your father in at the moment?
Hell be back soon.
She let him in, as he rested a hand on her head. Sarah got a little angered and embraced at the same time.
Im not a little child anymore.
Dr. Ackell laughed. Sorry, old habits die hard. He looked around, spotting two shoes behind the curtain. 
My, where is you little brother.
The little boy busted though the curtains, running to his sister.
He got in front of her, in a protective stance. Dr. Ackell gave another laugh. Sarah was less then bemused with her younger brothers antics.
Dont you remember Dr. Ackell?
Sarahs brother frowned even more, just glaring up at the other man. He turned his head to look back at his sister. Then the little redheaded boy stomped off into his room.
Im sorry, but I dont think he remembers you.
Dr. Ackell nodded. Its understandable, it has been awhile. But I think hes just jealous.
Sarah looked at him. Jealous?
Dr. Ackell took a seat in the living room. Well, the saying goes, a boys first love is his mother. And since his mother did die when he was young, you took that role of mother for him.
Sarah blushed. Are you sure?
Dr. Ackell nodded. Yes, but dont worry, hell get over it when he gets older.
Sarah looked away. Dr. Ackell smiled. Youll make a good mother one day.
Sarah smiled, more confident in that situation. The sound of a car pulling into the drive way broke there conversation.
Fathers home
The little boy looked down from his room, is gray eyes never leaving the man.

This burning. What is it?
Again, you talk. Are you me?
Why is it that I cant hold?
Why wont you answer?

******************************************************

88s eyes opened from his sleep mode. He was there, once again. In a small room only meant for one thing, a place to put him in. His door soon opened. It was a gray room, with  double numbers all around. His head snapped up towards a voice coming from the intercom.

All 80s modules. Report to Section A. All 80s modules. Report to Section A. Maintenance Check. Maintenance Check.

An even more un-emotional voice then his. 88 walked forward and turned, facing the exit door. There, standing in a perfect line, were other people. Numbers on their wrist ranged from 80-87. 89 no doubtfully behind 88. Once the numbers were in line, 80 started walking, as well as 81 and so on. They walked in uniform as they are programmed to do. The only difference in the programs ranged from 80-83, the commutation-information department, able to easily blend in with real people, 80 being the head command. 84-87, Manual labor, heavy lifting, other occupations. Be it for entertainment or experiment. Work only inside the factory, rarely do 84-87 leave the factory unless programmed. 88 and 89, assassin modules. Their only purpose is to kill when commanded by any of the modules whos number end with 0-1-2or3 (IE. 01, 10, 20, 22) after the orders are given to them by their human creator or owner.

That was what the programs were, nothing more then a mindless robot given little to work with. All the numbers spilt off into their areas, leaving 88 and 89 to walk alone. Both of the machines stopped at a door and waited for it to open. As it did, 88s eyes looked for someone in the room and headed directly to him. Will stood there waiting, for 88s check up, a sad smile on his face.

Good afternoon, 88. Is everything running ok?
88 looked at will, his gray eyes seemingly processing Wills words.
88 has kept up own maintenance, everything is running to par. His voice steady. Not as cold as it once was. Will shocked face quickly faded away.
88, please permit me to have a look still. Will rolled his eyes, he was doing it again, acting polite to a robot. One he was sure would kill him one day if he messed up with the higher ups.
Will sighed heavily. 88 glanced down at him. Is something that matter?
Will felt his heart rate beat faster. 88, are you concerned about me?
Concerned? What is that?
Will crossed his arms, trying to word the word concerned.
Its like, lets see, when Im worried about your parts, your maintenance.
88 looked at his arm. worried about my parts? The black numbers contrasted with his pale skin. 
I think I understand.
Will looked even more troubled. 88, do you remember anything from your past?
88s grey eyes moved to his right. Will smiled. 
You are remembering something, you are looking to the right. Trying to recall something once lost.
88 looked at Will.  My past? Once lost?

Will wanted to explore more on 88s knowledge of his past, but he knew that if he pressed on farther, he would be executed. 
88, dont acknowledge your past. At least not here. 
Will looked cautiously over at 89 and wonder if she too had suppressed memories of her former self. A theory he wanted to play with.
Understood. 88s voice was no longer the stoic cold voice it once was, a longing lingered within.
Will called over to the other fixer. 88 is done and ready for a mission.
88s questioning face became that of a cold faced killer. His eyes became even grayer then before.

Will watched silently as 88 left his sight. He wondered how long it would be before 88 remembered everything or when 88 would forget everything.  Will turned his head when he heard the fixer call out 89 and how she was also ready to go out on a mission. Will looked at the fixer with disgust, seeing the fat peak out through the mans clothing. His bald head and sweat stain clothing, told Will a tell-tell sign that he was stinky too. Then again, Will figured he only had true disgust with him because he did this for a living. Then again Will was also one of them.

Will sighed in defeat. He knew he was fighting a losing battle, but it didnt hurt to try. He got up from his sitting position and started walking away.
Will, where are you going. The other fixer called.
Will winched and stopped, turning his head slightly. Home.
The older man laughed. Nice joke Will, you have to go to that meeting today.
Will eyes narrowed. Damn it, I forgot that. He didnt forget, he just didnt want to go. Wills realization caught on.
And what of you Andre, I dont hear you volunteering to go.
Andre gave a hearty laugh.  Rod invited me to go with him to the Bahamas.
Will was filled with even more disgust, but his face didnt show it.
Howd you get to be so buddy-buddy with the boss man?
Andre laughed. You never did read the history here, did you.
Will mumbled. Yeah, about that, most of it was boring. He lied, he read the whole thing. This was of course before he thought he had the ideal job.
Andre was full of himself. Rod and I, we built this company from the ground up.
Then why are you here fixing the models? Will knew bullshit when he smelt it.
Andre laughed. Because, I like to create things with my own two hands.
Will laughed. Im sure you do, I heard you took number 85 with you.
Andre sighed grotesquely. Yes, she is a nice model. I picked her while I saw her walking to school one day.
Will felt sick. Andre saw 85 while she was human, while she was still living. The poor girl was murdered for Andres sick need. Ah, nice choice. How old?
15, neither to young, or to old. Andre laughed playfully, slapping Will on the back.
Will wanted to kill this man. So, you taking 85 with you?
Andre smiled. Yeah, I cant have her be alone while Im gone.
Will sighed, wanting to change the subject. So what time is my meeting?
In an hour or so.
Will mentally screamed the word Fuck, knowing hed might be stuck with the fat man for another hour.
So when are you leaving for the trip?
Now, my young worker. Rod told me today, Ill be seeing you later.
Will chuckled. Yeah, see you later. Have a nice trip. He said sarcastically.
Andre didnt hear it. Thank you my boy, Ill get you a souvenir.
Im sure you will. Will waved, a snake smile played on his lips. Normally Will would have never seen anyone off like that, but he had a feeling Andre wasnt coming back. Rod my have been a dick of a person, but he didnt believe in killing people who didnt need to die for personal needs. Then again Rod wasnt all that sane either.  Will watched as Andres plumped body waddled out of sight. An uneasy thought passed his mind that one day, if thing didnt change, Will himself might become another Andre.

A metal tray clattered as it hit the floor, turning Wills attention to the noise. After being scared to death, he relaxed and a small smile fell upon his face.
Clare, what brings you hear today?
Clare walked up to him, grabbing his hand softly. 
I came to get you for the meeting. I was requested to go too.
Will became confused. Whats the meeting about?
Clare rested her head on his shoulder.
The company is planning on cutting the 06-29 modules.
Will became pale. Cutting the modules?
They have become obsolete.
Will pulled Clare away from him. Fear in his eyes.
But what about you. If those modules go, what will happen to you?
Then I will become obsolete too. Clare cast her eyes way from Will.
Will looked down, thinking for a plan.
Clare, give me some time. I dont want you to worry till everything is talked out first.
Clare nodded as Will rested a palm on her cheek.
We better get going to that meeting soon.
Clare nodded, as her loose strands of hair danced softly a crossed his hand.
Everything will be alright Clare. All you have to do is trust me.
I do.

******************************************************

88 awaited in the darkness, his gray eyes fixated on Will and Clare. His mission was given and could be executed at the whim of his commander. 88s breathed in slowly, as if he was catching a memory of a life long gone, almost human. Something in his chest felt heavy. It felt hot.

******************************************************

This burning. What is it?
Again, you talk. Are you me?
Why is it that I cant hold?
Why wont you answer?

******************************************************

Because, we are not the same.

Chapter Four
Number 23 held the hand of his creator. A woman who had seen much in her life, left her with an uncaring face. Her gray hair matched her cold heart.
23 looked up at her and smiled. Momma, are we going out today?
The woman looked down at the imitated child. A smile did not grace her old, flat face.
Yes, 23, we are going out today. This will be the last day to do so.
23s hyper-ness peeked in curiosity. Why is that, Momma?
Because, youll be shut down soon.
23 didnt understand, but he held on to the woman harder. She pulled her hand away.
The woman walked away, with 23 following close behind.
Mamma, can I go see 88 before I go out.
The woman turned her head, look at the boy over her shoulder.
Do what you want.
23 stopped walking. He looked down at the ground. His eyes confused.
Do what I want. 23 started to pout. Mamma, I dont want to die.
The woman turned around in shock, her eyes widen.
What did you say? Her voice was lost to her, only in a whisper.
23 looked at her, pleading. I dont want to die again.

******************************************************


David, get down from that tree.

A little boy looked down from his perched position in the tree.
Im fine mamma, I just wanted to put the bird back in his nest.
His mother was visibly upset, but a smile graced her lips.
You are so kind David. Now please come down.
Her soft dark brown hair, moved gracefully in the wind. The boy agreed willingly.
David hit the ground, falling flatly on his but. Tears started to form around his eyes. His mother came up and grabbed his hand, picking the boy up off the ground.
Now, now David. Be a strong boy and dont cry. Your father will be here soon.
Davids tears vanished right away.
Daddy will be here for my birthday.
Davids mother softly pulled her son along. The two walked down a path way, looking at the landscaping. 
The cherry trees are lovely mamma. David looked up in awe. I want cherries to eat.
His mother took her free hand and put it under her chin.
Hum.there arent any cherries ready to be eaten yet.
David looked down, his brown hair covering his green eyes.
His mothers voice chimed a little tune.
But we can have Cherry Ice Cream.
Davids eyes widened, a rush of happiness resulted in him swinging his arms back and forth. His mother playfully swung along.
Happy 6th birthday David.

******************************************************

A door opened to a hotel room. The woman came walking in with a crying David in her arms.
Mamma, why didnt daddy show up?
Her face was cold, emotionless. Your father is with his other family.
Why isnt he like my friends daddy and live at home. He was whining, tears rolled down his red cheeked face. He rubbed his eyes, trying to stop from crying. His mother sat him down on the bed.
She played with his hair.

You have your fathers eyes and hair. She came over and kissed her sons cheek.
Why dont you calm down a bit. Momma will get you a bath going.
David nodded, as he laid down on the soft bed. His crying had exhausted him, as well as his disappointment. His eyes drifted closed as he herd his mother walking to the bathroom. He heard the water beginning to fill up in the bath tub. The running noise of water lulled the young boy in to sleep.

The woman walked out of the bathroom and looked at her sleeping son. A sad smile was on her face. She walked over to the bed and laid down next to him.
Im sorry David. If your father had shown up today, your birthday would have been wonderful.
She held him in her loving embrace. Tears started to roll down her own cheeks.
What a man your father is. Having a family on his own, when he has you.
Davids mother got up, with her son in arms. She walked over to the bathroom, tears falling freely.
Dont worry David, you will still have a nice birthday. So please forgive me, there will always be next year.
She stopped at the bathtub, looking at its still water. She sat down on the ledge, slowly putting David down in the lukewarm water. 
Davids eyes fluttered open sleepily. Mamma?
He looked at his mother, with a smile on his face. She looked down at him, and broke down in tears.

Im sorry. She whispered.

She pushed down on David, submerging his whole body in the tub.
She started to cry even harder, repeating sorry over and over again. 
David screamed underwater, but only his mother heard his muted voice. He clawed at his mothers arms, only to feel her hands tighten around his shoulders. He felt the water rush in, as he saw his mothers watery form fade away into dark. His thrashing slowed to a still, as his hands fell softly into the water. His mother let go, letting his body rest on the white porcelain tub. His eyes still opened, gazing at his mother. As if pleading. I dont want to die.

******************************************************

23 ran over to 88 and Will, who was fixing a cracked blade.
23 jumped on the counter, kicking his legs back and forth.
So, What happened? Pointing towards the blade.
Will answered, annoyed. His latest target knew how to fight back.
88s gray eyes fell upon the boy. My mission was finished, but why were you not at the command.
Will narrowed his eyes. He knew that answer.
23s cheery smile faded.
Mamma is going to shut me down again.
Wills eyes widened. Again? He wasnt even aware he was shut down before.
23 stopped kicking, he looked as if he was going to cry. Will wanted to reach out and pat his head, but he knew better. He went back to work on 88s arm.
88 raised his free arm and gently patted the childs head. This action nearly made Will drop his tools in shock. 88 was moving on the reaction of 23, as if they where human.
23 looked over at 88. I dont want to die again.
88s eyes didnt leave the boy. Will, I think Im concerned.
Will set his tools down, turning his chair towards 23.
23, do you remember anything?
23s green eyes looked alive. I remember cherry trees with mamma.
Will swallowed. Do you recall a name?
23 closed hid eyes, recalling the dream he had.

I was called David. He turned and looked over at Will. 23 is my new name now.
Will sighed, as he sat back in his chair. He looked up at the ceiling, sighing heavily. 
23, your creator had a son named David. But that was over 23 years ago. Will trailed off in his thoughts and went ashen white. Playing through the history of the company.
Rodale Reese and Andre Puff created Bond Found-land 30 years ago. Terri Anderson became co-owner of Bond, because her son and Rodales son where friends. But with Terris sons death, left her on edge with Rod.

Will crossed his arms and legs. 88 had long since put away his blade and was listening to Will story. The name Rodale, Andre and Terri where all familiar to him.
Was there ever a man called Dr. Ackell? 88 side glanced Will. Wills breath stilled. His eyes widen, the human element of fear was growing within his body.
88, 23 listen to me. All you past memories are very deadly to the living. What I am saying now, will probably get me killed.
Will looked towards the 6 cameras in the room. His bright mind, absently over looked them. 88 acknowledged Wills apparent fear and felt like he should calm him some how.
 Dont worry about those, I fed them a loop and audio has been shut off.
Will, who now relaxed a bit, smiled. Now why did you go and do that.
88 walked around the table.  I have noticed when you talked to me, you had be very quite. Careful to what you say and kept your eyes on things others would just see as common. The cameras and microphones limited your helpful knowledge, so in tern, I limit their knowledge as well.
Will stared in disbelief. How long have you been doing that for?
88 frowned. Now stop changing the subject. Who is Dr. Ackell?
Will smiled, glad to be free from the electronic recorders and able to have the long awaited conversation with a model.
Dr. Ackell, as rumor has it, is one of the real founders of Bond Found-land. Next to Rod. Andre Puff is.was just a person picked as a cover for Dr. Ackell, who wanted to stay hidden within the companies history. 
Will was beginning to feel more at ease, so he rests his arms on his knees.
But sadly, thats all I know of Dr. Ackell. Will felt guilty, for he knew more about Ackell then he lead on.
88 turned away, his gray eyes stirred with emotions. 
How did you know that name, 88?
88 looked down at the ground, doing an action that felt normal to him. Sticking his hands in his pockets, raising his head up to look at the Florissant light.
I cant recall.
88 let his eyes fall on 23. A ghost of a child he once knew in his previous life, flashed in something he wasnt supposed to have. Something that wasnt his, but something that he wanted. Those names, sounded so familiar. The boy, that hed known since his awakening, was back further in his memory. 88 wanted someone to talk to. Someone other then Will, other then 23. He wanted to talk to the ghost inside him. The ghost in the machine? Or the ghost of the machine? That was a question he wondered if he could get an answer for.

Chapter Five

A red haired woman ran down the rain soaked street. Her high heals echoed in the other wise silent blackness. She was breathing heavily. Her once curly hair was now ratted, full of leaves and mud. She hugged her body, trying to shield herself from the biting cold. Her run slowed to a walk and then to a standing position. She breathed in, trying to calm herself in the darkness of the night. She just stood there, thinking, crying maybe. The woman wasnt sure if the rain was tears or the tears was her rain. She looked up, at a lone streetlight that shined down on her. Her gray eyes flickered with loneliness, fear and heartache. The girl leaned forward, resting on the streetlight, as if it was a friend giving a reassuring hug.

He doesnt love me. 
She whispered to no one in particular. She raised her hands up and started wiping away the rain drop tears that formed. 
He only sees me as a child.
She slid down the pole kneeling. Small sobs escaped her mouth, as rejection set in. She tried to rub away the tears but they never seemed to stop, no matter how hard she tried.
A voice broke though the darkness, holding a cruel tone. 
I see no child here. A small laugh escaped his lips. Do you see a child my friend?
The girls gray eyes widen. She turned her head, looking at two men, their faces covered in darkness.
The other man laughed. No child here, just a whore on the street corner.
The girls eyes widened even more, tears falling faster then the rain.
She stood up, walking backwards.
No, please. She looked at the two men, then turned, ready to run for her life. But strong hands grabbed her, pulling her towards them. She struggled, they held her tighter. She screamed, they shoved her into the wall.
Shut up!! One of the men yelled, as he slapped her a crossed the face. She fell to the floor, dazed. The other man grabbed her by her hair, dragging her into the nearest alleyway. She held on to the mans hand dragging her.
Oh god, please no. NOO!!!. She screamed, as her struggling body got pulled into the darkness. Her pleads faded away in the night, as did her life.

What is it? In remembering what we want to forget.
What can you forget, when you dont even remember.
Are our memories valid? Or is it all fabricated.
Fabricated memories are just as valid as real memories.
Why are we so different?
Different is only the same in the end.

******************************************************

Clare sighed a heart filled relief. She was looking down at a piece of paper. This wasnt some ordinary paper. It was a notice paper, that she, Clare Donez, was not fired from her job. 
Oh THANK GOD.
She had dodged a bullet, more like a cannon to her or better yet a nuke. The lay-off had left many people without a job and many more without a life. She took off her glasses, as she leaned back in her chair. Her pink fluffy robe kept her warm, giving her a false sense of security. 
Clare was still working for the company and was promoted to the same area as Will, which made her very happy. But the lingering feeling of knowing she was close, made her wonder how far someone would stick their neck out for her. 
She glanced over at the clock, noticing it was 8:00. In another hour, she would have to go to work and help shut down Model Numbers 06-29. She felt sad about it, but she put that thought out of her mind. The mode Numbers 06-15, looked un-human, almost falling apart with age. The 16-29, was a different matter, for they looked human and acted human. Clare knew though that it was all program, nothing more. 
Clare had only been with the company for 8 years, two years less then Will. It was just that Clare was young, fell into a job opportunity that paid a lot of money and didnt care what she did as long as it didnt cost her life or her body.
She got up and walked over to the TV. She turned it on just for noise, because she didnt like the quiet that echoed in her single apartment. Her mind wandered as she listened to the news being reported.

Another body has been found today. This is the 6th victim this month. We fear that we have a serial killer on the lose. Its recommended that people travel in groups and to stay home at night. For those who work late hours..

Clare sighed, she wasnt going to follow those rules. She already knew the said serial killer. Clare wasnt a target, but none the less, she wouldnt walk out in the open like that. There was the scum of the earth to think about. The ringing of the phone distracted her. She walked over to it and smiled when she saw the name on the phone. She picked it up with glee.

Hello Will. What do you need this morning? 
She gave a chuckle as she blushed a little.
You are such a pervert.
She rested her elbow on the white tile of the counter.
Yes, I can pick you up, it wont be a problem at all. See you soon.
Clare hung up the phone, humming a bit. She hadnt felt like this since high school. She ran to her room to get ready.

******************************************************

Will hung up the phone. A small frown came a crossed his face. 
So Rod, what is it that you want to talk about.
Rods red hair was turning white, but his skin was tight around his face.
Its the Module Number 00.
Wills eyes widened. What about it.
Rod became angered. What about her.
Will swallowed hard. Sorrywhat about her?
Rod grabbed the coffee mug in front of him, slowing taking a drink.
Shes reacting. If I had known sooner, I would have done it quicker.
Will stood up fixing his tie. Rod was on his rant again, something Will chocked up to being old.
What do you mean Rod?
Number 88, if I had only had people killed quicker, 88 would have come sooner.
Will was becoming uneasy about the talk, he was afraid Rod might go on a killing spree. Then again he already was and had done so in the past.
But Rod, if you had rushed, you might have not gotten the results you needed.
Rod looked up at the younger man, looking up at him like Will was a saint.
Will my boy, if I hadnt had you around, I dont know what I would do.
Will begged to differ on that, but he wasnt going to tell his boss that. More-so when he wasnt stable mentally.
Rod glanced over at the clock, then back at the mumbling old man.
Rod, what is 88 to 00.
The connection is never ending. Eternity He stared blankly on.
Will noticed and felt concerned, the guy may be a nut but he did need to know someone cared for him. Will walked over to his closet, grabbing a blanket. He walked back over to Rod, handing it over to him.
I want you to stay here for today. You look tired and a little sick. Also, no one will know youre here, so you shouldnt be bothered.
Rod took the blanked slowly. He looked up at him and smiled.
Thank you my boy. You always take care of me. Ever since Sarah died. Rod rested his head on the couch he was sitting in, slowly drifting to sleep.
Will was confused. He didnt know a Sarah. Will headed for the door, because he didnt want Clare to know Rod was here. He looked behind him before locking the door. Dancing on the edge of a knife was something he never intended to do, but with his job, hes on the tip.

******************************************************

A young boy listened to the intercom above.

 Programmers, report to the technical department. Model Numbers 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, Report to technical department.

23 stared blankly at the metal box with wholes in it. He felt heavy. Having his creator telling him he is going to be shut down, scared him. 23 wasnt meant to be scared, he wasnt meant to feel that. The people behind him moved, complaining about the job before lunch. He turned around, looking lost. He wandered around, looking for a familiar face. One that he once called mamma. His fear became a frantic run, as he searched the crowd for the person that use to hold him close. Pleading sorry over and over again. He stopped when he heard her voice.

Can I have coffee. Black please.
23 ran to her in a full sprint, cling on to her squirted legs. The woman looked down, frowning at the nuisance.
23, what are you doing? She said boringly.
23 looked up at the woman, tears falling from his eyes.
Dont let them kill me mamma.
The woman became pale.

Why? Why are you crying?

******************************************************

Would Model Numbers 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, and 20, please report to the technical department.

Number 88 looked onward, as the loud crowed barked angrily at each other. Many people found out about the untimely death of their fellow coworkers, many 88 helped dispatched himself. 88 started walking, as no one was giving him orders at the moment. He didnt know where he was walking or why he was walking in the first place. All 88 knew, was he was being called. The metal clank on the floor was dulled my the panicked scientist. If fear if they dont follow orders, theyd be the next victims.

88 wanted to laugh, laugh at what, he wasnt sure. At the hysteria, at the emotions forming inside him. 88 didnt know, nor did he want to. The voice in his head, wouldnt leave him alone. It was driving him crazy. Crazy was something he was not use to, something hed rather leave dead. His mind wandered, as his feet traveled to a familiar, yet unknown destination.

He stopped, turned his head. On a capsule, red painted numbers seemed to scream. 88 spoke.
00.
He reached his hand out, touching the cold metal.
You know me, but are you the one I talk to?
He stayed silent, but no answer came.
88, what are you doing out? 88 turned, he felt like he got caught on something he shouldnt have done.
Will, I was bored.
Will was dumbfounded. Bored isnt in your program. 
Will looked at the container 88 was touching. Will recalled the words Rod spoke to him earlier that morning.
The connection is never ending. Eternity.
00, no start or end. The same with you 88.
88 dropped his hand. I hear a noise.
Will was about to ask, but Clare walked up. She was putting her hair up into a pony tail.
Come on Will, we still have a job to do.
Will gave a heavy sigh. Yeah, yeah.
Will went to go and walk off, but a firm grip stopped him.
23, where is he?
88 looked on blankly in Wills eyes.
Will looked away, not knowing if it was the coldness of 88s eyes or Wills own guilt.
Hes going to be shut down.
88 let his arm go. Protect.
Will started to walk away, confused by that word. Protect, protect what? 23?
Clare grabbed Wills hand.
Whats the matter?
The two walked together, softly swing hands.
Im thinking.
Will grabbed Clares hand, pulling her into an empty janitors closet.
Will?
You think you can do something for me?
Clare nodded, as Will held her closer.
It will be dangerous if we get caught.

******************************************************

Would Model Numbers 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29, please report to the technical department.

******************************************************

Clare waited at the door, waiting to work on number 23. She watched as Models started walking in, missed matched and un-orderly. Clare also noticed that the 20 Models looked different then 23. 23 was taken well care of as well as the youngest looking Model. She hadnt paid attention at the differences between Models, because she just saw them as things. Now, this thing has something special. And this Something was caused by its interaction with Number 88.
Clare looked at the clock, getting nervous by the second. 23 hadnt shown up yet and all the others Models had made their appearance.
Clare? Where is your Model. How come it hasnt shown up yet?
Clare turned to the person talking to her. Not sure how to react.
I dont know, maybe the programming is slowing in that model.
The person sighed. Clare couldnt put a name on the young blonde woman next to her.
Lucky, that means you dont have anything to work on.
Clare smiled softly. But still, where is 23?
Clare had a heavy feeling in her stomach, she had hoped Will had nothing to do with it.

******************************************************

Number 88 froze in spot while walking. He was getting an order from someone in the communication center. The voice that talked to him was human, but so cold. It was giving him an order for assassination. Many assassination has happened this month and this would be like no other. 

The Target. 88 spoke with his metallic voice.
The voice responded. Terri Anderson.
88 started moving again. Ready for the next mission. 88 recalled the name Terri Anderson and knew she was the creator of Number 23. 

88 started running now and jumped out an open window. He landed 5 stories below, landing on the ground, leaving an indent. Locking on to his target, to find his target. He used his ability to hack the cameras around the area. He ran to a building and jumped up, landing on top of a large Sky Scraper. He looked down, noticing that one of his cameras had Terri Anderson targeted. 88 was about to go after her but stopped.

88 froze in place, not knowing why. Just seeing the person she was with, froze him. Terri Anderson was with 23. 88 jumped to the next building, closer to the two. On his assassination hits he never hesitated, he did what he was programmed to do. This was different, Terri was with 23. Holding him close. 

88 jumped down and landed down front of the two. Terris eyes widen if fear. She held herself tighter around 23.

Please, you can kill me, but let David go.
23 looked over at his mama. Then back at 88. A small smile came on his face.
Mama said David. He closed his eyes at 88, tears falling.
David dont want Mama to die.
88 looked at the two, his face cold and blank. He raised his arm up. A blade shot out, ready to be swung down. For the second time that day in that same hour, he froze. 

88 retracted the blade, reporting back to head quarters.
Terri Anderson, Confirmed dead.

Terris eyes widened, as she turned her head towards 88. Still holding tightly to her son.
Why?

88 turned, ready to jump back up.
Our memories
He jumped, vanishing in front of them.

Terri sat there with 23 close to her body. 88 had left her alive, leaving her with 23. 
23 looked up. Mama, we need to go. 88 told me to run away and hide.
Terri got up. Pulling her son along. 
Where are we going?
A place they will never find us. Terri called a Taxi and the two left.


88 waited for them to leave, before he left as well.

Chapter Six

The sound of glass clinking and metallic chimes made music, in the otherwise silent room. A red head man would pause momentarily to write something down, before going back to his tinkering. The door opened behind him, making a screeching noise. The young man smiled as he walked through the door.

Father, what have you been doing all day.
The man turned to the boy, whos red hair was a darker shade then his.
Studying my dear boy. I think I have found my answers.
The boy looked over at his father, a small smile came a crossed his face. His youthful appearance, masked his true age. 
You know father, I have an idea. The one you wanted. Why not me?
His old man stopped breathing. He looked at his son. The thought had never crossed his mind to use his own son. With that idea, his smile grew larger. 
Ive never thought of it before.
His son sat down looking at the papers,  re-reading his fathers work.
But then again, Im just content not being one of my projects.
The younger mans eyes widen and his skin paled when he heard a click. The young man looked behind him.
Father, I was joking. Trying to crack a smile, but the look on the mans face told otherwise.  
His father walked forward. Youll see her soon. Then we will be a family again.
The young man pressed against the desk, looking for something to throw. In his blind luck, he found a metal bin. He tossed it at his father, while the gun discharged. A clang was heard, making contact with the bin. With the freedom to escape in reach, he just dodged the first of six bullets he knew was in there. Passing by the man he called father, through the door he came through.

He ran with such speed, that he could not stop before hitting a wall full force. Falling to the ground, he got up. Seeing his father was close behind him.
Shit!!
He got to the outside world, the snow falling from the dark skys. He ran down a dimly lit ally way. He saw his exit at the end of it. But a single shot rang in the night, as it seemed to echo in his ears. The pain was short, as it was unreal to him. Someone close, his own blood, shot him. He slowly staggered as his world started crashing down. The snow below him, dragged him down. Hitting the cold, unforgiving snow. He came to rest underneath a street light. His gray eyes staring up and the dim light. Blood was rushing out, making the snow around him tinted pink. Then his reality hit him.

OH GOD.
Blood trickled out as he spoke. Talking to someone who wasnt there. Seeing his breath slowly fade away with white puffs.
I.I think Im dieing.
He looked up at the streetlight, one of the last few things that would be burned into his mind before death. 

				Error 06

******************************************************

You know who I am yet?
I am starting to, and I fear it.
Why is it that you fear it? Is it that you fear who you once were?
More like who you once was. Not me. Not who I am now.
Why not you. For we helped make this nightmare come to life.
No, not me, it was you. Youre the monster.
Monster. Then arent we both. The bringer of life and death.
Your problem is you play god.
Then I am your god. I created it.
Then if you are my god, then..
Then what?
		
******************************************************


Clare looked out the companies building window. She looked down below, at the bottom. There she saw Rod talking to Will. She had wished she could read lips, to at least know what they are talking about.  Then again, would she want to.  She started walking towards her new office, when the office conversation caught her attention.

So, what are they going to the Model Number 85.
Well, she was used for sex, but I dont think anyone would want second hand goods.
I know man and shes cute too. But knowing she was that fat bastards plaything..
I guess they will shut her down.
Darn shame, shes a new Model too.

Clare frowned in disgust at her coworkers talk. Was it because she was feeling sorry for the Models now because of Will. Clare moved forward but stopped in the waiting room, to see the said Model Number staring blankly at a wall. Clare, for what ever reason, walked over and sat down.
She raised her hand up, patting her head. 
85? Are you alright? She asked concerned.
The robotic girl looked at her. A sad face, somehow graced its programming.
I want to go home. She said sadly.
Clare looked up at the ceiling of the building, sighing.
There is no home to go back to. Your owner is dead.
85 turned and looked at her. 
Not that home.
Clare was taken back. 
What home?
85 just looked at the wall. Clare grabbed her hand, pulling her along. Making her way down to the parking lot. She was stopped by a booming voice of the rent a cop. Clare cringed.

Hello, Randy, what is it that I can do for you?
Randy, the fat tub of lard, barked down at the other woman with authority.
What are you doing with that thing.
Clare smiled. Well, no one else was going to take her. So Ill make her mine.
Randy eyed her. Why would you want to take it. What need is she to you. Shes nothing but a sex toy.
Clare cringed again. The way the words rolled out like that, she felt like 85 might have gone to Randy next.
I want someone to clean my house and keep me preoccupied. Besides I cant cook to save my life.
Randy put his grubby hands in his pocket.  
Theres no qualification for you to take her out.
Then Ill do it tomorrow.
She grabbed 85s hand and walked away to the parking lot.
Randy raised an eye at her. He waited till she was out of sight before he made it back to his little office hidden in the corner. His grubby fingers reached for the phone.
Hello, Evanne. Could you connect me to Greg in Electronics.
Randy waited till he heard ringing on the other side.
Randy gave an evil smile. That bitch took my prize.
The phone on the other end was silent. Randys eyes looked confused, along with his face.
Evanne? Hello?

Static rang in the phone. Randy hung up, and tried again. This time, nothing, it was dead.
Randy looked over at his video monitors. They started to white out and fuzz, before going black. Randy put the phone down, pulling out his gun.
Sweat started to fall down his chubby face, as fear started to creep up. Horror movies passed in his mind, of all the horrors that could be around the corner. He looked around that corner and gave a little laugh.
Old boy, youll give yourself a heart attack with you imagination.
But his heart still raced, then for a moment, stopped.
It was faint, but he heard foot steps. It was rushing his way. Randy started sweating profusely now. He waited till the footsteps got closer, before he rounded the corner with the gun. He pointed and froze. As did the person on the end of the gun point.
Randy looked down at a young woman. Her eyes wide with fear, she would have screamed if she had the mind to do so. Anger kicked in.

Jesus Fuck Randy, get that thing away from me. She yelled.
Evanne, Im sorry. I thought
Randy put his gun away. Evanne ran her hand through her short black hair, trying to shake off the idea that her brains could have been of the floor.
The power went out in Sector A. 
She frowned. A rat hit the breaker. I was told to come down here and tell you.
Why running?
Evanne looked pissed. I have to tell Floor Zero A, to Floor 4 A. So I have to get it done.
Randy went to go back to his office.
IF thats all. Then you can do the rest of your errands.
Evanne didnt like the tone of his voice.
See ya, fatty. She left, heading for the stairs.
Randy was pondering if he should put a bullet in her head.

He sat back down, hearing the chair screech in pain. He gave out a heavy sigh, before leaning back. He was still angry at Clare. He closed his eyes, letting them relax a bit. He calmed himself down. In the distance, he heard walking again. 
Im getting paranoid. He spoke to himself.
The footsteps stopped. The next noise he heard, froze him in fear.

I dont think so.

His opened his eyes. Looking directly into cold metallic gray ones. A scream tried to escaped from his mouth but a sickening gurgle was heard instead.
 
A bloodied blade retracted back into 88s arm, leaving a red line up his wrist.
88 looked over from his arm, over to Randys split head. The blood was gushing out like a river, as the earlier splatter painted everything around them. 88 stared, fixated on the red pool below the body. His mind was trying to recall something again.
88s attention shifted when he heard echoing footsteps. Just as quietly as he had gotten there, he had left just as silent. 

The passerby never noticed Randys little corner office. Nor did he noticed the sound of dripping that echoed with a soft beat.

******************************************************

Clare was driving her car, with number 85 in the passenger seat.  Clares heart beat was pumping a little bit faster then shed felt comfortable with. 
She gave off a soft chuckle. Feels like I just robbed a bank or something.
She glanced over at 85. From some reason she hoped to get a reaction out of her, but nothing happened.
She turned her attention back to the road.
Where do you want to go.
Home. 85 pointed forward, something on her face showed a ghost of a life.
Tell me how to get there.
Clare drove, following 85s directions and these directions lasted far into the night.

******************************************************

Will was on his cell, calling a number over and over again, while driving the car at the same time.
Clare, honey, pick up your phone. Where are you. I didnt see you yesterday and you arent in your apartment.
He gave a worried sigh.
I know I sound like a wife, but Im worried for you. Call me when you get this and the other 6 or 7 messages I left you. Love you.
He hung up and drove into the parking lot of the A block. He found a parking spot and parked like normal. What wasnt normal, was the smell he smelt when he opened the door. Other passerbys covered their noises at the smell. Will knew that smell all to well, it was a smell of a dead body.

What happened? He asked one of his co-workers.
Some one killed Randy.
Will walked over to the office, to take a quick look.
Cops not here yet? Will asked while looking. He cringed a bit seeing the mess. Even more so, knowing who did Randy in, but why?
No, just called them. The person started to freak out a bit. Do you think its that killer? The one that killed our fellow workers?
Will was ready for this.
Maybe someone has a grudge against the company. Some disgruntled employee.
Will started walking to the stairs. The man looked at him in shock.
Where are you going?
Will looked back.
Up where all the other people are. No way Im being alone with a dead body with a killer on the lose.
Will started back up, but slowed walking. He pulled his cell out of his pocket.
Hey Clare, call me Baby. Starting to get real scared here now. Love you.
He hung up, having the pit of fear growing even more.
He heard behind him the man asking him to wait up. A small smile came on his face.

******************************************************

Clare drove to a rich town. Passing by a high school, seeing students heading off to school in their uniforms. 85 looked out the window, as if knowing some of the people in the group. Clare drove around some more, before 85 spoke again.
Stop here.
Clare did as told. 85?
85 opened the car door, not bothering to close it. She ran full speed up six steps, leading to a red painted door. A small cross rested above it, with the words, Ashley, Our Angel. embedded in it.
85 pushed the button to the house as it rang. 

Clare looked on in awe and shock. To see how eager 85 was to reach that door. She looked on, waiting to see what happened next. The red door opened. A man, looked down at the girl in front of him. Tears fell down as he reached out and grabbed her, pulling her into a hug.

Ashley, my baby. How, oh Ashley
85 extended her arms, hugging the man in front of her.
Daddy. Im home.
A woman soon joined them. Joined in the tears and shock. 
Ashley looked up at the woman. Momma.

Clare smiled. She was unsure of what to do. She did know she had to go, get as far away from 85. She hoped the company would never find her. The one thing Clare was glad about, was that her previous owner never put a tracking chip in her system. If so, theyd know where she was and take her back, shut her down. Her family would most likely be killed too. Clare reached over and closed the passenger door. She drove away, never looking back at the girl who was returned to her family.

Clare grabbed her cell, getting read to tell her company that she wasnt going to make it today. She turned her phone on and smiled a bit.
The cell spoke back to her in a robotic pitch.
You have 32 messages.
But her smile fell a bit. She knew who those messages belong to and she know knew what he meant. About how the models are still human.
When that realization hit her, she also knew now why Will wasnt afraid of death. She was sure that Will was ready for it, by the creations of their own work. Their own greed.
She dialed her phone to Wills.

******************************************************

Will sat, waiting. Waiting for what, he wasnt sure. A call? Any call? A person? Or a Thing? Whod be there first, Clare, 88, or someone else to dispatch him. There still was Number 89 to worry about.

He jumped a bit when he felt vibration in his pocket. He gave a little smile, feeling stupid for being scared by a cell phone. He looked at the name and smiled reassured.

Clare, where have you been. I was starting to worry.
Will leaned back in his chair.
You mean you dont know, Roily Pollys dead. Someone did him in.
Will leaned forward, resting his elbows on his desk, a calm expression settled in.
You know, you had me worried. I thought you had gotten killed too you know.
He smiled, looking out at the window of the building. The graying sky made it look like the sun would die out.
Be safe, drop by my place when you get back.
Love you too. Bye.
Will hung up, still sitting in his chair. He look forward at his desk, his face was very steady. He glanced his eyes at the single door to the room. There stood a tall, older gentle man.

Hello, Dr. Ackell. Its been along time.
The man walked in, a cane in hand. His dark hair was graying and his aging was graceful then to most men.
It has been awhile. I have been preoccupied to grace you with my appearance, Henslin.
The smile on Dr. Ackells face was unsettling. Will just sat in his chair, looking out the window once again.
Its rather surprising to see you out, did something change with 00?
She spoke.
Wills eyes widen. He was expecting no change, hoping for no change.
So, shes awake?
Dr. Ackell clenched his cane. 
No, shes still dreaming. Shes just talking. He stopped walking as he too looked out the window.
How is your babysitting doing?
You mean looking after Rodney? Will moved, scratching his neck.
Dr. Ackell smiled.
Yes, that useless man. Has he gone completely crazy yet?
Will closed his eye, getting ready to cross into uncharted territory.
He called me his son.
Dr. Ackell looked down, his frown visible in the widows reflection.
Be careful Will, because he did kill his own son. He might confuse you to that far.
Dr. Ackell turned, ready to leave.
Join me in Basement D. I need help with 00.
Will nodded. 
Ill be down in an hour or two.
The older man walked out, closing the door behind him.

Will stood up, stretching out a bit, before sighing heavily. He looked over to a corner.
So, did you hear all that, 88?
88 walked out, seeming being there the whole time. His dark glasss reflected the florescent light. He lifted his hand to take his sunglasss off.
His gray eyes shown with something that wasnt there before.
That man 88 looked down, a frown on his face. Hes the reason, the start of it all.
Will gazed at the man in front of him. His attention was pulled away and the sound of cracking thunder.
88 looked at his arm, the tattoo of his given name. His gray eyes, lost in confusion.
Sarah? Is that you calling?..Or is it someone else?

******************************************************

You know who I am yet?
I am starting to and I fear it.
Why is it that you fear it? Is it that you fear who you once were?
More like who you once was. Not me. Not who I am now.
Why not you. For we helped make this nightmare come to life.
No, not me, it was you. Youre the monster.
Monster. Then arent we both. The bringer of life and death.
Your problem is you play god.
Then I am your god. I created it.
Then if you are my god, then..
Then what?

		I am your Devil.

Chapter Seven
Its all your fault!! A man yelled. Smashing the other man against the wall and holding him there.
The man pinned, fought back, but nothing could beat the rage of a father.
You bastard, if only, if only she hadnt of lied. His grip lessened, as his body began to shake. 
The other man looked down at him. Even if he did towered over him, he wasnt winning the fight.
He brought his hand up, and rested on the grievers shoulder.
Im sorry, for the pain I caused, Rodney.
The man crashed into him, crying.
Greg, you bastard. Whyd you let her run out.
Greg smiled, not one of a sorry man, but of a wicked one. His rich dark hair, matched his dark cool blue eyes.
I have an idea, one I have been playing with for awhile now. I just need more time. He spoke calming.
Rodney looked up at him, desperation in his voice.
What do you mean?
Greg smiled, this time caring, hiding his true goal.
Bring her back.
What?
Rodney stepped back, giving Greg room to move.
Ive been working on a project, if it works out well, then we can bring your daughter back.
Rodney nodded in agreement. 
You can do it? Bring her back?
Greg smiled.
Yes.
A screech at the door caused the men to look. Greg smiled coolly, as Rodney walked towards the boy at the door.
Daddy, I had a nightmare. A young boy in his pajamas rubbed his tear streaked eyes. 
Rodney picked the boy up.
Come now my boy, let daddy tell you a story, then off to bed.
Ok daddy. He rested his head in the crook of his fathers neck.
Rodney turned to look at Greg.
We will talk about this later.
Greg nodded.
Ill be here waiting. He rested against the wall, watching the father and son leave. In hearing that they where gone, he walked over to the phone and dialed a number.
Terri, your mistake will be erased soon. So please hang on a little bit more. I just got a major benefactor into our project.
He smiled wickedly.
Playing with those who are in mourning are the easiest my dear, as you already know.
Good bye Terri, see you soon.
He hung up the phone, waiting for the man he just played, to return with open ears.

******************************************************

You know, hope is a funny thing. People follow it blindly like a religion.
I dont see hope as that. I also dont know why you think you are god.
Im a god, because I can talk with her.
That other voice I hear, calling me?
NO!! Why would she call to you.
I just hear a voice, full of sadness.
Your lying, she isnt sad, she isnt.

******************************************************

88 stood a crossed from 89. Energy was sparking more then is should with these two models.
89 spoke, her voice as cold as it was for 88. Her long blonde hair, glowed in the darkness.
Youre a defective model, I am told to terminated you.
88 took his glasss off, dropping them on the ground. His gray eyes set on his target.
Given orders I assume by Dr. Ackell.
88 moved his right arm out, bringing his hidden blade out. It sang in the darkness of the night.
Correct.
She moved her left and right arms, guns appearing out of it. She fired.
88 dodged behind a pillar, the bullets bouncing off and imbedding into an adjacent wall. 88 smiled, a true first time since he became 88.
You are always the loud one 89.

89 kept her static look, set on her orders to terminate. Her blonde hair flickered back and forth, as she flipped backwards into a corner. Her eyes looked around for her target.
89 stood up from her position, speaking with out fear.
We are of the same program, we know how to blend in with the darkness. Silent to our victims. Why go against your program.
89 fired into the left, hearing footsteps. 
We have killed many, due to our orders. How can you go against your programming?
88 leapt down from the ceiling, blade sharp, slashing down. 89 dodged with easy as she rolled to the right pointing her guns at the target. The bullets connected, but 88 moved on, placing his left hand on her head, smashing her on the ground. A crater formed around the impact point.   
Her blue eye looked up at the ceiling, black blood flowed from her ears, nose and mouth. 88 brought his right arm down, ready for the kill.
Why. She choked.
88 stopped, blade away from her neck.
Why what?
He said coolly, eyes looking down at hers.
Why are you so special. How can you defy our programming?
Tears started to fall from her empty black eyes. She raised her guns, ready to fire once more. 89 arms dropped heavily to the ground, unmoving.

88 moved his right arm and cut her head off. He looked down at her, a shell of a former person.
Why am I so special. The question he did want to know, was given to him by another number.
He looked up, now noticing the light that shined down above them. He stared up, fixated on that light, the light he believed would illuminate the darkness of his memories. Tears started to fall from his face.

Why?

******************************************************

Dr. Ackell looked over at his computer screen, a red mark blared, screaming almost. Will also glanced over, noticing that Dr. Ackell looked very disturbed.
Is something wrong?
Dr. Ackell turned and spoke bitterly.
89 was taken out, this is rather troubling.
Will turned back, becoming pale.
Taken out, what do you mean?
Dr. Ackell walked over to his desk, looking for something.
I sent 89 out on a mission, to terminated 88. He smiled, finding the item he wanted.
Ah, there it is.
Will herd a click behind him. His eyes widen, but he gave a little smile.
Hey now Greg, if you kill me now, youll never know the passwords.
Dr. Ackell cringed. Your smart, but not that smart. He kept the gun steady. As a smile crept on his face.
The things is, Will. I know how to use people. All you have to do is find the right emotional link to control someone, anyone.
Will narrowed his eyes as he turned around. His smile was completely gone.
You leave her alone.
Dr. Ackell laughed. Your emotional connection with that woman is strong.
Will leaned on the desk he was working on. And you never had any connection with anything human?
Dr. Ackell ran his free hand threw his hair. Not even my own wife and children.
Will crossed his arms, shrugging. Your as cold as your machines.
The man waved the gun, signaling Will to move.
I find that as a complement. I never could fit in with the human race.
Will turned his head, looking at the door. Why are you doing this. What do you have to gain?
Dr. Ackell placed the gun at his back. He gave a little chuckle. I honestly dont know.
The two men walked out of the room. Leaving the computer to beep.

******************************************************

The balding red headed man, stared at a metal container. The black numbers 00, spoke back to him.
Sarah, how are you doing today?
The gray metal and bolts, stayed unmoving. The single glass window, showed the tanks inside. Green glowing water and air bubbles filled the windows. A lone figure, floated in the center, with hair floating in every direction.
Ah, my lovely girl, you are so wonderful. Would you like to hear a story from daddy?
Rod turned his head, when he heard footsteps approaching. A smile came to his face.
Ah, Will, my boy. What are you doing. His smiling face fell, when he saw Dr. Ackell.
You, what are you do A booming shot ranged in the metallic room. Will looked on in shock.

Rod looked down, at his chest. A whole, shot threw his body. His eyes started to glaze over, as he fell to the ground.  Will ran over to him, holding him up.
Old man? Putting pressure on his wound. Rods hand came up, resting on Wills.
Dont worry about me. He smiled up at him I had it coming.
Will looked over at Greg. The gun still steady.
Oh yes, he did have it coming, his propose has been fulfilled.
Will yelled at him. You bastard, how many people have you played to get this far.
More then you know boy. Now get moving.
He relentlessly stood up. Your not going to let me live, are you.
It depends on what orders you follow. Now move.
Will started walking again, as Greg made his way to Rod.
To let you know, I did care for your daughter.
Rod looked up at his killer and smiled. Greg
A single shot rang, a bullet to the head silenced him.
Will looked away. Greg turned his head, looking at the metal container.
Can you feel it Sarah, that the time is near. I look forward to your resurrection.
He turned to his hostage. Well now, lets go. Im almost done tying up the lose ends.
Will turned away, being more angry then scared. He knew he was walking on thin ice, he just didnt want to take anyone else with him. Will would play along, as long as he could. The two left for Wills car.

******************************************************

88 looked around him, waiting for Will to show up to fix him. The damage to his left arm was hindering his functions. He waited for hours, but he didnt come, no one did. 88 was getting restless, something he didnt like. The emotions that he was feeling, was something he was not to have, but was able to get. That something was programmed into him, but by who, he did not know. He wanted to know. That was something that alluded him. Memories that belonged to him, plagued him and yet they are not his. 
They belonged to someone else and that person, he considered worse then him.
88 walked around the room, looking at pictures on the wall. Pictures of people Will knew. 
There was one that looked like a birthday party, another picture had just Will and Clare. Many people 88 didnt know, but then, one picture caught his eye.
It was Will, he was sitting a crossed from another man. The nameless man, triggered a shock to his system. His eyes widen, when he gazed at that smiling face. 

This person.
88 touched the picture, tracking around the figure. Is the one I awoke to.
He looked down at his hand. I also killed him. Underneath that light.
His gray eyes clouded with confusion.
Who are you to me? He asked the man with sandy dirty blonde hair.
He begged the question that he wanted, but would never get.
88 narrowed his eye, as a loud bang shot threw the wall. He turned and looked behind him. There was a male and female model. The numbers 78 and 79, tattooed on their faces. 88 frowned, getting rather annoyed with the hit list on him.

I take it, you two wont give me an answer like 89? He spoke to the two.
Neither of them spoke, just moved, with speed faster then 88 expected. 78 came charging at 88, gun firing, empting the load behind the wall where 88 once stood. 79 pulled her whip out, grabbing 88s damaged arm, using her strength to slam the younger model. 88s face didnt register the pain he should be feeling. He took his arm with the blade and cut the whip. He fell on the ground to dodge 78s kick, which connected with the ground, missing 88s face by an inch.

88 grabbed 78s foot, extracting his blade to dismember 78s leg. The metal slashed threw the joints with ease, as 78 fell to the ground, losing balance. 88 rolled to get away, standing up to face the onslaught 79 was going to dish out.    
 79 brought her whip to a tight stretch, as 88 had his blade in front of him, ready to slash it. He was fixated on her, ready for her next move. 79 charged forward, 88 ducked, a single bullet rang.
79 fell backwards, as a visible bullet in the head marked the kill zone. 88 stood up, turning around to look at 78 who was on the ground, with a bullets in his arm. 88 smiled.
Thats the thing with old models, they get replaced by the newer ones.
78 fired more shots, but 88 dodged with ease. He vanished from 78s sight, only to appear behind him. 88 slashed his blade down.
78s head rolled on the ground, as his body fell with a heavy thud.
88 looked down at the two defeated models. He now knew it wasnt safe at Wills work station, so he decided it was best to find Will himself. 88 hoped that Will was better off then he was faring. 88 turned to leave, he glanced one last time at the damaged photo. That man, was something to Will and his former self.

******************************************************

Clare heard a knock at the door, she walked over to it with caution. She looked threw the pick whole and smiled. She opened it with a smile.
Will, why do you have to knock for your own home?
Clare then noticed, Will wasnt smiling. Then her smile faded away, when she saw a gun. There was a man she had never seen before.
Will?
Clare, sit down and shut up. He said with no humor in voice.
Clare moved out of the way for the two men to enter the room. She didnt say anything, only followed orders. Clare wasnt going to argue with the guy with the gun.
Dr. Ackell smiled when he saw the woman. My dear, you are my trump card.
Clare looked at him, rather spooked that he was reading her mind. She looked at over at Will, who grabbed his laptop. He started to type franticly.
So, how long have you been planning this little ruse of yours?
Dr. Ackell pointed the gun at Clare. 
I did Rodney in, I can do your cute little sweetie no problem. Now quit talking, start writing.
Will flinched.
Ok, ok. He frowned.
Clare knew things would  become dangerous, but she stayed with Will because she loved him. Regardless of what troubles shed be in.
Will tested his boundary, as he figured it was his past time now. Someone will find his body in due time.
Dr. Ackell sighed, but smiled any ways. What do you want from me, my plan?
Dr. Ackell walked around tapping the gun to his head. Will wished for the gun to go off accidentally.
My dear co-worker, you expect me, to tell you my plans. What fool do you take me for.
Will mumbled, giving a small smiled.
Trying to lighten the mood. Im a rather talkative person.
Clares eyes bulged at bit, as she barked at him.
Is this a time to be making jokes, he has a fucking gun.
The older man erupted with laughter.
It seems your old lady has more sense then you Will, she knows who has the power.
Will frowned and only deepened when the computer beeped, telling it was finished with his project. Will had to think fast.
I have the program uploaded, but its still password protective. We have to go back to the cooperation to..

Will screamed and fell backward, clutching his left leg. Dr. Ackell smiled, he had pulled the trigger.
My hand slipped.
Clare ignored Dr. Ackell and ran to Will, who was bleeding on the ground.
You son-of -a-bitch. He cussed at the man, looking up from the ground.  
Will She pressed down on his leg, trying to stop the flow of the blood.
Dr. Ackell flicked his gun.  Get up, Im taking both of you with me.
Clare helped Will pick himself up. He leaned on her for support. His nose fell softly on her hair, he smiled a bit. Strawberry shampoo. Something so small, became very aware to him. Clare started walking, dragging Will along, keeping the pace the man behind them allowed them to take.
Clare looked up at Will.
I love you. She spoke, hoping it wouldnt be her last.
I love you too. He held her closer, regretting he dragged her deeper into his world of hell.
Dr. Ackell looked at the two. A taste of disgust lingered in his mouth. Simple human life, he distasted it all. Love he considered a problem that should be eliminated, but for some reason, that girl whos life was taken, made him feel remorse. So there for, hes bringing her back, to kill that emotion.

******************************************************

You know, hope is a funny thing. People follow it blindly like a religion.
I dont see hope as that. I also dont know why you think you are god.
Im a god, because I can talk with her.
That other voice I hear, calling me?
NO!! Why would she call to you.
I just hear a voice, full of sadness.
Your lying, she isnt sad, she isnt.

******************************************************

	Can you not hear her?
	I can only hear you.

******************************************************














Chapter Eight
A young man ran down a metallic hallway. His footsteps echoing with every step. His dirty blonde hair flowed with the wind, as his green eyes lit up with the florescent lights. He took a quick left, making his way to his destination. He wasnt expecting to run into someone almost his own age. Slamming with such force he brought the person to the ground as well.
He mounded as he laid on the cool ground. The light above him seemed to mock at his pain. His head had connected directly with the others, which he had sworn echoed in the metal rooms. The next thing the blonde knew, he got a kick on his bum. He lifted his head up to finally see his victim. His eyes widened when he saw the person in front of him.

A red headed man, somewhere in his early twenties, held his head. A look of annoyance graced his soft features. The younger man almost blushed at his gawking.
Oi, what do you think your doing? This isnt a playground. He pushed himself up, rubbing his head.
The younger man now looked up at him, still awe struck.
Wha?
The man looked down at him, giving him his hand. The younger boy took it readily. It shocked him to see how strong he was, considering he looked quite delinquent.
Im sorry. I wasnt paying attention and..
Why running so fast?
The younger man stuttered. 
There was a meeting Im supposed to be at. He looked down, getting nervous. He looked up when he heard the man laugh.
You mean the hiring meeting right?
The younger man nodded. Yeah, that one
Oh, youre an hour late. We had daylights savings yesterday.
The blonde mans green eyes freaked out, as he started to panic.
What? I missed it. Oh no, how will I get a job now? Being late like that. I, I
He started ranting till the man started laughing again. A reassuring hand rested on his head.

Dont worry about it, your hired already.
The boy looked up, bewildered.
Wait, what? How?
The red head winked at him. Sticking his thumb at himself.
Im your boss kid, I read your papers. Your Jeremy Higgs right?
Jeremy nodded his head very energetically, then he looked very confused.
Wait, youre my what?
The older man smiled, gesturing for them to start waking.
I read your papers, youre the top of your class. You became a college student at age 13, and.
Jeremy got over excited. And what?
The man smiled. And, I can see you doing great things for this company. A new mind, for this old organization. I want you to help me take this company further then anyone else can.
Jeremy blinked.
How can I do that? Im still considered a child, I cant even drink legally yet.
His new boss smiled.
Rules are meant to be broken, after all you already broke quite a few. Care to guess how many?
Jeremy looked down at the ground, counting all the rules he was breaking. Sleeping in, not properly dressed, his energetic attitude, being late for a job, running over his new boss. Not saying sorry for doing so.

Uh six, no wait seven. Ah, sorry about hitting you. He also counted his speech.
The man smiled. Resting his hand once again on the boys head.
No, just one major one.
The boy started to freak.
Which one is the major one?
The red head put a finger on his lips.
That, Jeremy, is a secret.
Jeremy looked confused. His boss was an interesting character. The red head started to walk faster again, leaving the confused boy to drag behind. Then Jeremy shot up, and started running to catch up.

Hey wait? I dont even know your name, Boss man.
		
				Error 08
******************************************************************

I killed someone very close to you, didnt I? Is that why you have awoken?
He was like a little brother to me.
Your being kind.
To him, I was, to everyone else, I was a demon.
 Why a demon to everyone else, was it because you experimented on people?
No, it was because I dragged people down to hell with me.
Why did you care for him?
He didnt know who I was.
So, he was your heaven?
He was my only link.
To what?
To my humanity.
	

*******************************************************

88 held his damaged body. He was getting slower. The bombardment of attacks left him physically damaged, but the mental damaged he was receiving was taking a toll more. 88 heard voices in the distance, so he had to find a quick place to hide. 88 silently jumped up behind a pillar corner. His eyes glanced down at the three people, they narrowed.
Clare was walking with Will, whos leg was drenched in blood. The man behind them, made 88s cold blood boil. 88 waited for Will and Clare to pass him by, before jumping in between the three.

Dr. Ackell didnt looked surprised when the red head showed up before him. Will and Clare looked back.
88... Will turned with the help of Clare.
You two, get out of here. 88 had his back to the two. Clare nodded as she pressed forward, moving in a quicker pace.
Dr. Ackells eyes set on 88, momentarily forgetting the other two living beings in the room.
My, the last time I saw you, was when you became re-started.
88 turned his head. I dont remember you from that. I do recall you from before.
Dr. Ackell smiled softly. From before? You mean your former self?
88s eyes became angered. I recall fragments.
Dr. Ackell steadied his gun on the damaged model. His calm expression didnt portray anything.
Fragment? Do you not recall then why you agreed to do this.
Agreed? Who would agree to this. 88 yelled.
Dr. Ackell put his gun away. He turned, taking a step back.
You agreed to it. His voice was that of sympathy.
What? 88 held his damaged arm, not sure where this man was getting at.
I took pity on you, only because I was the main cause of it.
It? 88 leaned on a pillar. That It was someone close to both him and Ackell, but what of 88.
Yes, it. Your dear sweet sister. Dr. Ackell opened his arms wide. With her death, it was the start of it all. 

88 looked down at the ground, letting the man pass him by. Dr. Ackell made his way to the long corridor. 88 moved slowly behind him. 88 looked around  him, noticing that he was in the 00 corridor.

The giant room, bigger then that of his holding containment. This whole room, contained computers of all shapes and sizes. In the center held the Model number 00 in a spear. 88 let his eyes fall on a dead mans body.  It left an uneasy feeling on him. The man was someone to him, someone to 88 as well.

My father. My killer. My creator. 88 spoke coolly.
Dr. Ackell smiled. Ah, yes. That man. I killed him. His usefulness was long over due.
88 walked over the dead mans body. You killed him. Was whispered.
Dr. Ackell walked over to the main computer, typing away in his glee.
Let me tell you 88. That man, gave you an order to kill the man who altered your chip.
Who was he? 88 knew that answer, but still could not place a name.
Jeremy I believe. Such a young child in this organization. He had dreams, which had been turned into a nightmare.
By my original self?
Dr. Ackell smiled.
I guess so. Its a shame that Jeremy did die. He could have be useful at a time like this.
88 fell to his knees before the man he once called father. Anger had mixed in with gratitude. The man before him, gave 88 a life he shouldnt have. After all, that man did kill his son. 

88 turned his head to the sound of an opening container. Liquid ran out of its opening, flooding the area around them. The blood that once pooled below, was now a muddled pink. 88 stayed, unmoving. Dr. Ackell, had other plans.
Now that she is free, I need to finish lose ends. Ill just follow the trail. Hinting that note as Clare and Will.   
88 ignored the mans ramblings. Before him stood a naked woman. Her red fiery hair, covered her face, trailing on the floor behind her. One eye fixated on 88 and the dead man behind him. She walked forward with such grace, as if gravity was non-existent. Dr. Ackell smiled at his creation. He walked over, slowly to her. He took off his lab coat, placing it around her bare shoulders. Her ivory skin seemed to mash with the white coat.

Oh, good evening Sarah.  The older man brushed the red hair out of Sarahs face. Black markings of 00, tattooed below her left eye.
Sarah didnt acknowledge the man touching her. Dr. Ackell became a little unnerved
Sarah, why wont you speak with me? Are you still mad at what I said to you. If it makes you happy, I can say it if you want. He got in front of Sarah, blocking her view of 88. Dr. Ackell rested his hand on Sarahs shoulders and smiled.
I love yo.?!

88 looked on in horror. The man in front of him, was no more. The model number 00, Sarah, had slaughtered him. It wasnt the death that startled him, but the killing. There was no visible weapon. Dr. Ackell had been standing, then he was ripped apart.  No scream, no action, just pieces. The water 88 was kneeling in, was now crimson red, no longer the shade of pink. 88 looked up, fear was welling up inside him. The woman, Sarah, 00, walked closer to him. 88 stayed un-moving, covered in blood. The once pristine coat, was painted in vibrant red.

The newly awaken model walked passed 88, to the dead red headed man. She kneeled down, letting Dr. Ackells blood fall off her. She lifted his head, resting it on her lap.
Good morning Papa. She spoke childishly. Look I am awake now. She started to hum a song.

88 let a breath go, not knowing why he had even held one to begin with. The woman before him was familiar, but it wasnt her. It wasnt the kind and loving person he, no, his other self knew. 88 didnt look back at the girl cradling her fathers head.
Your not Sarah are you?
The humming that echoed the room, stopped. 88 was starting to feel pressure on his back. 
That man called me that too. I hate that name. My name is. 00 stopped speaking. A realization overcame her. She looked down at her father.
Hey daddy, what is my name. You said you would tell me when I wake up. I want to know my name.
00 spoke happily, not knowing the true effect of what was going on. 88 spoke.
Hes dead. The man you killed, shot him.
Dead? Then he can be brought back. Then daddy will call my name.
88 finally turned and looked at the girl. Her young features, told of lost innocence.  She looked at him with green pleading eyes.  A familiar face, but different soul.  A pain shot in 88s body, as a memory of the boy he once called Jeremy. How it pained him now, to know that it was he, who killed someone close to himself. Having that want to bring the dead back to life, was human.
No, he can not come back. He wont be your Papa.
00 yelled. Your lying. Daddy told me the dead can be brought back. He told me while I was sleeping.
00 leaned over the man, holding him close. He told me I have a brother, who will protect me. 00 held the dead man tighter. 88 flinched when he heard snapping bones. He said I would live happily ever after.

88 stood up, bringing his hand out. His blade extended. Damaged, but capable of killing. His body creaked with movement. 00 looked up at 88. The smile on her face, mashed with her falling tears.
Where is my happiness?  
He lied. There is no such thing.
00s eyes went cold, as 88 swung his arm down. Her eyes locked with his gray ones.
Justice?
The blade stopped an inch from her neck. 88 looked down at her in shock, eyes widen.
What?
00 then smiled. It was a smile of bitterness and trickery. In a flash, 88 felt hot pain move threw his left eye. A bullet was shot from 00. She had taken the gun from Dr. Ackell, from the moment she had killed him. 88 fell backwards, hitting the water and making a splash. With his right eye, 88 looked up at the blaring light. That light was over shadowed by 00.

He told me that name. The name of my brother. I remember my brother. You are not my brother. She stood over him, trumpet of her victory. She put the gun up to his only eye, pulled the trigger. To her anger, it clicked. 
Oh well. I guess I will kill you like I did that man. Her smile was that to match the devils. Her attention was driven by a scream. It was a janitor. The new arrival had pleased 00, making her forget 88 in his status. The janitor started to run away, with 00 following behind him. Her enjoyment of the chase, would make her awaking, a bloody one. 00 started humming a song, she heard long ago while she was asleep. The song echoed in the room. 88 looked up at the light, lost in a daze. That song, was something to him. It made what was left of his heart, feel pain. The memory of that song, that little hum, made his world fall into white. In the white, a memory past his way.

Jeremy, sing that song just for me. A red headed man glanced over at the youth. Jeremy smiled, as he walked his way over to him. 
Who else would I sing it to if it wasnt for you, Justice?

************************************************************************

I killed someone very close to you, didnt I? Is that why you have awoken?
He was like a little brother to me.
Your being kind.
To him, I was, to everyone else, I was a demon.
 Why a demon to everyone else, was it because you experimented on people?
No, it was because I dragged people down to hell with me.
Why did you care for him?
He didnt know who I was.
So, he was your heaven?
He was my only link.
To what?
To my humanity.

*****************************************************************

		And now youre a human?
		I abandon it the moment I took him along.

Chapter Nine
The white light took everything over. There was no start, no end, no wall, no floor, no ceiling. 88 stood among all the white, being alone. His body unmarred by the events that happened moments before. 

Hello? Anyone there? He called out. There was no answer. He called out again.
Justice. Is that your name. Are you me? 88 called out into the white emptiness.

A shadow appeared behind him. It was another him, but it wasnt him. It was Justice. Both men now looked at each other face to face.

Quite at predicament youve gotten us into. Justice smiled.
Us? What a joke. I am me. You are the one whos dead. Even 00 says so.

Justice walked around 88. The two could pass off as twins, if they werent the same person. With every step Justice took, the white started to gain color. The white world they where in, changed into one of a small plaza. 88 looked around, not sure of the area around him.

Have I been here before? 88 asked, feeling that he was here. Justice smiled, leaning near 88s face.
You havent been here before, but I have. Justice turned his back to 88. He started to walk, heading his way to a bench.
So, in your life, you have been here. What is this place? He went to join his past self.

Justice sat, resting his arms on the back of the bench, glancing up at the blue sky. 88 joined him, but rested his arms on his knees, looking at the ground. Justice smiled as 88 frowned.

This place is my escape. I come here to think of what to do next.
And what is there to do next?
I really dont know. After all, you did get shot in the eye.
By your sister none-the-less.

Justice snapped his head, the comment about his sister made him angered. He stood up, getting ready for a fight. 88 looked up amused, the small smile was almost an insult.

What are you going to do? Beat yourself up? 88 cracked.
Justice fumed but didnt do anything, he just sat back down muttering. Shut up.
88 looked down at the bricked floor. 
So, what are we going to do? 88 asked, no joking the second time around.
Thing didnt turn out the way we planned it.
By we, you mean Dr. Ackell right?
Justice nodded. We had a plan, but he didnt stay with it. Also, Jeremy got in the way.
88 looked down, he felt his heart hurt when the name Jeremy was spoken. Justice felt the same, but for a different reason. 88 speech became serous again.

Why did you two do this. 88 corrected himself. I mean the five of you.
Justice remained silent for awhile, before answering.
Cant you recall yourself?
88 clenched his teeth, he was getting pissed. I dont have your petty feelings.
I did if for family. He said flatly. I did it so I could see my sister smile again.
So by playing God, you help create this. With your father, Ackell, Terri and Jeremy.
88 stood up, grabbing Justice by the collar of his shirt. Justices dull gray eyes reflected in 88 lively ones. 
You wouldnt understand! You have no idea what I lost when I lost my sister.
Why wouldnt I understand? We have the same memories, the same past. What is so different?
Both men knew that answer. Jeremy, that is whats so different.

88 let Justice down, whatever anger was left over, faded away with frustration.
Its why I am here.
Its why other models gained a soul.
88 turned his back, walking away from Justice. Justice reached out to him, unsure of what to do next.
Where are you going?

88 turned and looked at his former self in the bright plaza.
Im not going to let this soul I gained, fade away with Jeremys memory.
88 faded away, leaving Justice alone. Justice let his hand drop, leaving a smile on his face.

Ill be here waiting till its over. 


			Error 09

************************************************************************

I just have one question.
What is it?
Its about Dr. Ackell, why was he involved?

As you said, we liked playing God. He just took it farther then we thought he would.
All this to a God complex. I am sure Hell is waiting for you.


************************************************************************

88 opened his only eye. The gray slowly started to comeback to life in it. The water around him, was still tinted pink from the massacre 00 had left behind earlier. 88 stayed unmoving for the time being, adjusting to the reality near him. He pushed himself up slowly, before looking around in a sitting position. 88 noticed his movements had become stiffer and was in need of maintenance that he could not perform on himself. 88 pushed himself up into a standing position. He started to walk, the splashing of water echoed with every step. 88 held on to his arm, not looking down at the man below him, nor the man scattered around the room. He walked through a door, into a new nightmare.

88 saw the hallway before him. Everything was red. Many people he had saw moving in and out of the company. The people who shut models down, even a few models themselves lay among the carnage of death. 88 just walked forward, ignoring the soft squish that would happen occasionally.

88 felt what was left of his heart, race in fear of Will and Clare. Not knowing of their fate and knowing of what 00 could do to a person with her bizarre ability. 88 stopped abruptly. Something echoed in the long corridor. 

88s eye widen. It was laughter, laughter of children. 88 quickened his pace, making the walk turn out into a full staggered run. He made it to the door, with the words Day Care painted in bright colors. 88 moved his hand slowly to the door knob, he turned it with a soft click. The laughter stopped. 88 pushed the door open, a silent squeak of the hinges, was all that was heard. Then the sound of flesh being dragged, connecting with the opening of the door. For the first time since 88 had awaken, he felt like he wanted to puke. The room was covered in blood. Chunks of flesh, meat and bone, scattered everywhere. 88 walked forward into the room, stepping on a toy that called out Mama in an ironic robotic voice. The only other door in the room was opened, with a bloody trail leading out to the main building.

88 stopped halfway. He started laughing a bit. Talking to himself.
How am I to stop something like that. Something that can kill so easily. 
88 walked again, slower then he would have liked. He had no idea where he was walking, all he knew was he wanted to move. The area around him seem to blur. The silence was almost madding. Then a voice binged in his head out of the darkness. The voice was a familiar comforting one. 88 smiled in the bloody mess he was trekking in.

88, what is happening. I felt you fade away. The voice called out in fear for his friend.
23, where are you? Please tell me you are not here? His voice cracked.
I am not. 23 spoke with a little energy, unsure of 88 condition or state of mind.
88 looked around, the area he was in now was the mess hall. It had yet to grace the presence of 00. For now, it was a safe place. 88 spoke to 23 again.
00 has awakened. Do you know of ways to shut the system down?
23 spoke up, hearing 88s voice returning to normal. 
The older models like myself had to be shut down manually. The newer models can be shut down with satellite, but it targets all models in radius. This was meant as a fail safe.
88 narrowed his eyes. He was unsure if 00 was considered old or new. 00 had a different programmer and also knew the 00 wasnt the first model created. Just the name was given as the one to work with, as to 00 wasnt the type to fall into any of the categories.
Can you tell where 00 is 23?
Yes, 00 is still in the building. What has 00 done?
It is a massacre. 88 stopped talking when he heard something being knocked over. 88 brought his arm out, slinging out the blade. The movement came from his blind spot. He stopped the blade inchs from Clares neck.

Holly shit. Clare stared down at the damaged blade. 88 retracted the blade. 
Are you unhurt? 88 asked, glad at least there was a living person around.
I am. Will on the other hand, I am afraid he might die of shock. He lost so much blood.
Clare brought 88 over to Will, who was hiding behind the trash can. Will looked up, un-amused at Clares comment.

Im not dead yet. Wills leg was wrapped up, but still bleeding. His attitude changed when he saw how damaged 88 had become.
I see your not faring well either 88. Dr. Ackell do that to you?
88 tried to smile at the attitude Will and Clare where giving off, but he knew they didnt understand the situation.
Not all of it. 00 has been awakened. Ackell is dead, 00 killed him. 00 also killed people along the way. I was afraid she may had gotten you two as well.

Clare was on guard duty, keeping an eye out for the robotic killing machine. 
Is that why all the screaming was about? Her voice worried.
88 nodded. The Day Care center is a mess.
Clare went pale, she knew half the children there. Wills labored breathing became heavier after hearing that thought.
00 has been around long before I showed up. Will looked over at 88, his face was rather sad looking. I know Greg and Rod worked on 00, but those two werent the only ones.

Will pushed himself up, taking the feeling a bit dizzy. He wobbled his way over to 88 who took a spot sitting at a lunch table. Clare helped Will move forward. 
What are you doing? 88 was worried.
Will sat down. He steadied his breath.
I still got two good hand. I can at least fix something off of you. Clare, do you think you can make it to my office?
Clare nodded. Is it locked?
Will frowned, unsure if he had locked it or not. I dont know. I lost the key somewhere along the way.
Clare walked over to Will, giving him a hug. Will inhaled her sent. She smelt of strawberries, a re-fresher then the blood scented building. 
Just be careful. He whispered to her. Clare broke away from the hug, giving him a kiss before running away.

88 looked on, wondering if Justice had someone that close as well. The song that 00 hummed gave him a flash of memory. Something small Justice was willing to show him.

Will sighed, ignoring the pain in his knee.
88, only five people worked on 00 and they are all dead.
No, not all. Terri Anderson is still alive. I didnt eliminated her or 23.
Will looked on in shock. Shes still alive! If we talk to her, we might be able to stop 00.
I am talking with 23. We have connection due to our programming. 
88 hit a small button underneath his skin. Out of his ear, a voice could be heard. It was that of a child. Will was happy to hear its annoying voice.
Will, its so good to hear you again!! 23s hyper energetic voice was offset to the scene.
Its good to hear you to, you brat. His voice faded a bit. Is Terri around.
Im listening Will. David has been informing of what is happening.
David?
Thats my name, my real name. 23 piped.
Will smiled. David is a good name.
88 felt his heart feel calmer, having almost everyone there with him. 
Terri, you know the programming system for 00, correct. Will asked, getting to the point.
Yes, I know the programming system. 00 was set with the manual shut down drive, but that was taken out when the Model 60 was created. Since the Models could be shut off in groups, Rod thought it would at least be a fail safe, if anything had gone wrong with 00 programming.
Wrong, as in how?
Dr. Ackell had been tinkering with 00s programming system. He tapped into experimental projects, along with the help of Jeremy.
So there is a fail safe? Any ideas on how to access it?
I have no knowledge of it. You did look after Rod, even in his failing mentality. Did he mention anything to you?
Will thought for a bit. Trying to think back to any hints Rod could have dropped. After all, being human, many people give out information without knowing subconsciously.
Nothing that comes to mind.

88 spoke, giving Will more time to think.
Anderson, can I ask you a question?
Yes?
Why? Why do all this, what reason? I have already gotten one answer. Why go as far as you all did?
Silence filled his ears, then the voice shattered that silence.

It was because we opened Pandoras Box. All of us knew what we were getting into, so we all took a vote and not look back. Even the person you came from, followed that vote.

88 sighed heavily, an act he was taking on by learning from Will. A smile fell to his ragged face, knowing he was be coming more human then his counterpart.

Quite a mess, if anything. Will interrupted. He glanced over at the clock rather nervously. The pain in his leg was now just a numbing dull. He leaned on the table he was sitting by. 88 rested his good hand on Wills shoulder.

You doing alright?

Will smiled, glancing over at 88 who was more far gone then he was.

That should be my question to you. Im just worried, its taking her to long. Will glanced up into the ceiling, looking up at the artificial lighting. The detaching silence was something he had never grown accustom to. Will had hoped it wouldnt be a normal thing in life, after all, he did have Clare who made his life noise. If her noise was gone, Will figured life wasnt worth living anymore.

I just have one question.
What is it?
Its about Dr. Ackell, why was he involved?

It should feel like home.
Ah, that made me laugh.

Chapter Ten
Sarah, Sarah!! Look what I got!!. Justice opened up a book to his older sister.
Ah! What is this? Sarah looked on, seeing the bright colorful pictures that exploded in front of her.
Its a pop-out-book. And it moves when you push this button. Justice brought the book back to himself, humming a little tune while he was at it. Sarah looked on. 
Who gave you the book Justice?
Daddy did.
Sarah smiled, a little shocked that her father would do such a nice action in his busy schedule. Her attention was pulled away from the opening of the door. Her smile grew even bigger.

Daddy, your home. Is everything ok? She was unsure of his homecoming.
He walked over to her, handing her a small box. He planted a small kiss on her forehead. Justice looked up at his father. Rod looked down, resting a hand on his sons head. 

Everything is fine. We just made a break through. Ms. Andersons project was very successful. With that I can be home more often. He gave his children a big smile.

Sarah ran into her fathers arms. Hugging him tight. Justice joined in as well, not wanting to be left out. She pulled away to look at her gift. She opened it to reveal a heart shaped locket. She ran into the restroom to place the necklace on.

Thank you daddy. She called out. Then in a flash, she ran to the kitchen. Im going to make a good dinner tonight. Something to celebrate with. Ill make your favorite daddy.

Rod laughed as his daughter ran past him. Justice held his book tight. He looked up at his father, standing by his side. Rod looked down.
Can I do something special for you daddy?

Rod kneeled down, eye level to his son. Resting his hands on the boys shoulders, he smiled.

I want you to be like you are now. By my side, making me happy.
Justice smiled. I can. I can. He called out. Rod smiled, then pulled his son close into a hug. Justice giggled a bit.
Daddy, your hugging me to tight.
Rod let go. Ah sorry. I just wanted you to know I love you.
I love you too. Justice looked down at his book. Im going to show David at school tomorrow. He turned his back to his father, while he ran to the kitchen to see his sister.
You do that. Rod spoke, a sad smile fell on his face.


				Error 10

******************************************************

It hurts. Why cant I breath?
Its not because you cant, its because you can.
What?
I thought youd notice by now. Your alive.
Im alive? Then what about you.
Im already dead, my time in this world is no longer. But.
But?

******************************************************

Clare leaned against the wall, looking around the corner. The eerie silence was off setting, making her want to go back into the safety of Wills arms. When she noticed her path was clear, she headed off into a full run. Clare stopped once again, this time next to medical office. Clares mind wandered, she figured she could also get more supplies for Will while she got 88s maintenance gear. She jingled the handle to see if it was open, to her relief it was.

She let out a heavy breath she had no idea she was holding. She walked in, almost normally, then faltered. There in front of her, was a naked red headed woman. The one thing she didnt want to run into, was in a room she should have avoided.

The young red head woman turned, raveling the two Zeros that marked her face. Her smile written on her face as to being found. She reached out a bloodied hand out at Clare. Clares face fell, not sure of what was going to happen, or what she should do. So she spoke.

Are you alright? She asked, her voice a little shaky.
00 lowered her hand. Her smiled now unreadable. Are you not trying to kill me.
Kill you? Why? Clare walked forward. She had the uneasy feeling if she had tried to run, she wouldnt get very far.
00 looked at her bloodied hand. Someone tried to kill me. 
Clare walked over the medical counter, grabbing cleaner and a wrap. Her hands shaking with every move she made.
Is that why you are hurt? She turned to the naked woman, who was now huddling herself into a ball. Clare couldnt almost believe what 88 had told her earlier and she almost couldnt stomach the idea of this thing slaughtering children.

I killed them. I killed them all. 00 hissed. A wicked smile fell on her face, looking over at Clare, who stood a few feet away. Her voice cracked into wicked laughter.
Can I clean your arm? She kneeled down to 00s current crouched position. Clare hoped to play nice and try to get away from the ticking time bomb before her. She reached out, grabbing the damaged arm with ease. 00 didnt react, Clare wasnt sure if that was a good or bad thing. What Clare did notice was the warmth in 00s hand, something not found in Models. The flowing red blood that fell from it. Models dont bleed red blood, their blood is to be black. With what and how long 00 was in hibernation, Clare pondered if this was a resurrection, a re-birth. A life brought back by science.
This will sting a bit. Clare gave a warning as she pored the cleaning sedative on her hand. 00 did react, slapping Clare a crossed the face sending her a crossed the room.

Clare slowly pushed herself up. Holding what felt like a busted jaw. Her red cheek was starting to grow swollen. She moved her way back over, to the still sitting 00. Clare was determined to look at the wound and what had exactly wounded her. If she found out, she could tell 88, in hopes he might have better luck then the one who damaged her before. That being permitted that 00 would let her live in the first place.
 
00 just looked on at the woman, unsure if she was just crazy or stupid. Her gray eyes moved back to the non-existent object in the corner that seemed to keep her attention momentarily. Clare grabbed the bandages she dropped from the hit and knelt down once again to 00. She prayed her second time wouldnt kill her. She went though the same routine, but this time without the cleaning sedative. Clare looked down at the ground, picking up the cloth she placed down moments before. She wiped off the blood on 00s hand to revel a bite mark. A chunk of meat was bitten out of her. Clare couldnt understand how 00 saw this as a threat. A bite like this, was something a person would get while defending themselves. Clare took the bandages and wrapped 00 hand up.

We dont want to get it infected now do we? Clare asked.
00 took her hand back readily, looking down at the white bandages. Almost matching that of the color of her skin. 00s long red hair, drowned out the blue color of the tiles on the ground. Her gray eyes seemed fixed on her newly bandaged hand. Clare then started to walk back, grabbing a small medical box slowly. With every step, she took with ease. Making sure she didnt make any un-necessary noise. She reached her hand out as far as she dared. When her warm hand clasped cold metal, did she feel her heart beat thunder in her head. The door slowly opening, her exit just millimeters away. 

She made it. She made it through the door. Then, she closed the door behind her. The soft click rang in her ears. Her near-death experience still lay behind the closed door. She took a soft step back, before turning and running into a new found speed. She found it easier to run, when knowing where the threat was. The only thing she knew would hold her back, was getting back to Will and 88. Because by the time she grabbed the things for 88, she was sure 00 would be out wondering again. She didnt have time to waste in her middle aged state, Clare was just happy that she did Pilates.

******************************************************

Will looked around nervously. If he could, he would be pacing up and down. If he could, hed be the one getting the supplies. But no, he was there. Half drained of blood, with a shoddy patch job on his wounded leg. 88 stayed posed at an open door, keeping watch for either Clare or 00. Seemingly ignoring the panicking man.

Whats taking her so damn long.
Calm down, not like its going to be easy for her. 88 sighed.
Says you, your already dead. Will snapped.
88 turned to look at Will with his good eye. His expression wasnt one Will was expecting.
If she is dead, will you bring her back like the others. Play God again?
Will weakly punched the table. Shut up.
Why dont you. What dont you get about hiding. 88 turned his attention back to the empty hallways. Will mumbled, falling to submission. 
When did you become a smart ass.
88s stern face broke into a smile when he saw a burnet huffing and puffing down the corridor.88 limped away from the door, going to join Will at the tables. Wills head snapped up. 

Clare?
She came in at full speed. She slowed to a walk when she got to the others. Will smiled, almost standing up to give her a hug in his blood loss state. The woman took her man down in a steady grip. 
Dont you dare get up. She put down the small medical kit, grabbing a bag of plasma.
What are you doing? Will asked stupidly.
Giving you something to stop you from fainting. She rolled up Wills sleeve, inserting a needle into his arm. 
You know what you are doing? Will asked again, this time being irrational.
Dont you remember, I use to be a Night Nurse before working here.
88 frowned. His lack of blood is really getting to him. He stopped feeling the pain over an hour ago. What happened?
Clare glanced over at 88 while she was working on re-fixing Wills leg, this time without being rushed.
I ran into 00 in the Medical Section of the base. She was wounded slightly.
88s eyes widened. He leaned in, trying to listen better.
What damaged her?
Someone bit her on the hand. She saw it as an attack and killed them.
88 reached for the tools to try and fix himself, since Clare was pre-occupied and Will was useless.
How did you get away? With his free hand, he started fixing his own leg. 88 wanted to make sure he could run.
I fixed her hand. It was the only thing I could think of. She spoke as she wrapped the leg even tighter.
So, she was bit 88 kicked his leg back and forth, hearing a rather sickening snapping sound. It wasnt the sound that made him cringe, it was the thought of 00 being bit. Whatever memories 88 had of his life as Justice, knowledge of Sarahs death was gruesome. 

Will leaned forward, laying his head in the crook of Clares neck. He was starting to drift off to sleep. Clare pushed Will up, slapping him to try and awaken him. 88 just smiled on in amusement as he started to work on his damaged arm. 

The stainless steal blade was dull and damaged. A new one was needed. 88 knew the bullets that riddled his body would cause more damage as time moved on, but hed had to make do with what he got. 88 looked around the room with his good eye and was rather disappointed that in the area, the closest visible weapon was a fire extinguisher.

Why the hell is weapons located down below?
Still resting on Clares should, Will looked over and cracked a smile.
Is that sarcasm I hear in your voice?
No, its my cheery out look at life, what do you think.
Oh look Clare, our boys a teenager now. They grow up so fast. Ow!!
Clare flicked Wills ear, to get his attention back.
If you are talking about children, then you better marry me at the end of this.
Did you just propose to me? 
Clare gave a heavy sigh, 88 chuckled.
I think she means to shut you up.
Will just dug his head back into Clares shoulder and mounded. His mind was getting numb.

88s head snapped up to a slight click. The smile that happened to form, was gone in a flash. The cold faade returned, as did his alerted movements. He shot up, moving back to the door he was guarding before Clare had arrived. 88 leaned against the door opening, his ears hearing the clothing scrape metal. 

Clare helped Will move to where they hid last, as well as trying to keep the man quiet. She glanced over from the trash can, keeping her eyes on the man who was their only protector. Her eyes widen in horror as she saw the Model tossed like a rag doll to the other side of the room. The wall 88 happen to hit, dented and cracked. His damaged body, hitting the ground with a sickening crack. Clare pulled Will farther into a corner, using her body as a cover. In hope to look smaller in an area that she felt, would turn into a battle field.

88 pushed himself up to his knees, gritting his teeth to block the pain. 88 coughed, as the wet matter trickled out of his mouth. 88s eyes widen when he looked down at the ground. The black blood that once ran in his body, was now a vibrant red. This made 88 panic, this panic made him fear his mortality. For a flash of a second, he feared he would die again. 88s gray eye looked up, his red hair swayed. The woman before him, stood at the door way he was at seconds ago.

88s gaze seemed lost. The redheaded woman walked in, smiling casually. Her hair seemed to flow with her, untouched by the horrors that she had caused. 00 marked plainly on her face, was the only thing that marred her face. Her elegant walk, her soft steps on the metallic ground as she made her way to the fallen Model. 88 stood up, regaining his composer, to face 00 head on. The only thing 88 could not do, was walk forward. It was the fear that stilled him. The naked woman was a few inches from 88. The height difference between the two was far and between, but the resemblance between the two was unmistakable. Siblings. 00 reached out her unmarked hand, gently caressing 88s bloody cheek. 88s good eye faded away from fear, to longing.

.Sarah? 88 spoke, he leaned forward into a waiting embrace.
00 held on tight to the damaged body. 88s body relaxed, falling into something familiar.
Is that you? Justice?  She closed her gray eyes, her smile never leaving her face. 88 felt the hair behind his back being pulled. The strength is 00s grip, retched him back, making him fall down to his knees again.
Sarah? He chocked out.
You are not my Justice.

88 was forced to looked up. The light above him, seemed to outline 00s form. The angelic light, hid the demon within. Something inside 88 wanted to save that innocent smile she shined down at him. 88 reached out, grabbing to the only thing that grounded her to the world of the living.

Chapter Eleven
Justice sighed as he leaned on a railing. Out below him, was a massive park. The cool breeze, froze the air around him as he exhaled. Winter was coming, but fall still had its beauty in the park. His gaze wandered down to a park bench, where he knew if hed sat down, he wouldnt want to get up for awhile. The bench seemed to win in its favor. 

Justice looked up at the blue sky, the birds flying south passed by without a care. He sometimes wished he could be a bird. Where to fly away and be lost in the flock, not be grounded by human problems. A soft kick to the leg brought him back down to reality. He smiled a bit, already knowing who it was without looking.

Jeremy, what brings you here today? The youth joined him on the bench, handing over some hot drink in the process.
I was walking with mother when I saw you walk down the path. Thought Id drop by and say hi. Jeremy took a drink out of his sweet flavored drink, letting the warmth run in his body.
Ah, and here I thought you were a stalker. Justice smiled, as he took his turn for the drink. The smell of white chocolate graced his nose. His smile grew even more.
I am right, you are a stalker. You know my favorite drink. He teased.
Jeremy blushed. I am not. You yell at me all the time to buy that junk.
Justice snickered. And what junk are you drinking?
Hot coco, that aint junk. He said proudly.
You mean isnt. He corrected.
You!! Jeremy barked back.
Justice busted up laughing, as he turned his attention back to the park in front of him.
Thank you.
Ah, anytime.Hey, can I ask you something? His bright eyes shining of curiosity.
Yeah sure. He took another sip.
Why do you come here almost every day?
Justice stopped drinking, turning to look at Jeremy. His gray eyes mirrored that of sadness, and a bit of anger. But Justice didnt put it against the boy, after all, he didnt know. 
My sister took me here, the day she died.  
Jeremy regretted that question he asked. He didnt like the sad face that graced his friend. 
I am sorry. I didnt mean to
Justice knocked his employer in the head.
Dont be, it was so long ago. He looked back at his drink. My sister bought me white chocolate, because she knew I hated the milk chocolate. So, its why I drink it all the time. Justice ran his fingers through his red hair. Ah, sorry, I havent told that to anyone before.
Jeremy stood up, in front of Justice. Dont be. This time in turn, knocking Justice in the head, a little bit harder then intended. Justice looked on in amusement. Jeremy was a kid alright.
If you ever want to talk about anything, Ill be there to listen, but in turn, I dont ever want you to say sorry to me. Besides, I am your underling, I have to look out for you.
Justice cracked a smile.
Underlingyou make it sound like Im the devil. But I do appreciate it. So thank you.
Jeremy smiled. You are welcome.
Jeremy!! A woman called for the youth.
Ah, moms calling. Ill see you at work tomorrow Boss Man. Jeremy waved as he ran off. 
Justice smiled, as he rested his hand on his cheek.  This park for him, was full of happy memories, of old and new.

Wake up, you have to. You arent like me, so wake up.
Damn it, Answer me!!
You have a reason, my reason is waiting.
Wake up, wake up.


******************************************************

The soft smooth red silk that played on his battered hand, almost looked as if it was blood. 88 moved his good eye, to the flowing red, his vague look seemed to be lost among two worlds. The world of the dead, and the world of the living. His voice spoke once more, as he grabbed on to that hair.

Sarah. He cried out like a little boy.

The woman in front of him froze. Her wicked smile, fell away into fear. Then fear melted away into something else, acknowledgment. 00 knelt down, grabbing onto 88s gripping hand. This grip, was softer, not like the first touch she gave him. 00 landed on her knees, before she took her arms and wrapped them around 88, pulling him closer.

Justice, where have you been? 00 cooed, her gray eyes matched his lone one. The cloudy innocence of something new and innocent, yet already spelt so much blood.


Clare held onto Wills head, who was now fading away faster then she had hoped. The whole scene that played out in front of her, was something she knew she would never forget. That is, if she lived. The sound of a door opening, made Clare freeze with fear, her grip tightened around Will as she turned her head. It was an employee from the PM shift. The poor girl had no idea what hell she had just walked into.

Her scream, seemed to bounce off the walls. The sudden shock and rush of blood, seemed only a mere memory of what she once was as she blew up like a balloon. The human body, was now just a chunk of flesh that sloshed on the ground. 00s gray eyes seemed to glow red with anger, to have her moment with her brother disturbed.  Clare began to shake, so scared, she couldnt blink. Tears started to fall from Clares, when 00 laid her eyes on the other two occupants of the room. 00s eyes faded away back to gray, as she turned her attention back to 88. It was 88s turn to shake. 00 once again, killed without a thought. 

Sarah His mind wandered back to the Daycare. Of the toy he stepped on, the soft smacking sound with every step. The metallic smell in the room, that was different from the metal that was merged with him. 88 leaned back, his warm back connecting with a cold wall. His gray eye, focused on her face. 00 smiled, a smile similar to Sarah, but it wasnt Sarah. Justices memories mixed in with 88s current view of the nightmare. For that short moment, it clicked. This person in front of him, wasnt Sarah. That poor girl died that night in an alleyway. This thing, was what was left in the broken and smashed body. The fear, the hate, bitter soul of a monster wanting revenge. The only thing holding her back from a total massacre, was the memories of a little brother, a father whom loved her and a life that was cut short.  00 had every right to be angry, but to take it out on the innocent was no better then the men who took Sarahs life.

88s hazy eye, turned clear. There was nothing clouding his hesitation now. With his newly fixed arm, he reached out, extracting the blade hidden within. In one quick moment, the smiling face as no longer on the naked body. Hair and tendons cut, merged with the flowing blood that pooled on the ground. The body fell limp, into 88s embrace. He held on tight, tears flowing down is good eye. His bad eye, cried blood. His gaze fell onto the smiling face, finally set free from the mistakes that lead to her resurrection. Somewhere in all that confusion, 88 closed his eyes and faded away into nothing.

******************************************************

The sound of beeping, a heartbeat rhythm, played in the hospital room. A very rugged Will opened his eyes to a puke colored room. Will moved his left hand, noticing that it was heavier then usual. He moved his head, seeing a sleeping Clare holding his hand. A small smile fell on his pale face.

Hey there. Looks like Im in Heaven, I got an Angel by my side. He whispered jokingly.
Clares eyes shot open, as she leaned forward.
Will!! She called out rather loud, causing the man to wrench at it. Will felt like he was suffering from a hangover.
Dont yell baby, Im not dieing. He flirted with a smirk.

Clare fumed. Id be mad at you if you werent on drugs. Still, you and your sense of humor amazes me at times like these.  

Will looked out the only window of the hospital room.
I wouldnt be saying it if we were dead. His eyes fixated on the gray moving clouds.
How did we get out, I dont remember much after blacking out.

Clare sighed heavily, then got up to close the hospital door. She made her way back to Will, taking a seat where she was almost minutes ago. 

88 killed 00 when she was venerable. I saw it happen, but I still dont understand it. Clare went back to thinking, then spoke again. I think if 00 was more aware of what was going to happen and less confused with what was really going on. It would have been a lost battle. She crossed her arms. After that, Terri and 23 came in. They took 88 out of there before calling the cops.

Ha, Cops! Where the hell were they when the shit hit the fan. Will shot out.
Clare sighed again, growing more irritated. She knew the drugs would effect his system, she prayed it wouldnt have been that bad, but playing God for awhile, she wasnt sure if she was aloud to.

Wait, they took 88 out of there.then called the cops. What the hell is that about. Im still alive, 88s already dead.
Clare gave a stern smile. Well, about that.
Will pushed himself up slowly, resting his back on the wall to look at Clare.

About that what?

******************************************************

A young boy sat on a windowsill, kicking his legs back and fourth. He hummed a song from long ago. His bright eyes, seemed to glow behind his grown hair. The wind that blew, gave him goose bumps. The sound of gravel being driven on adverted his attention. His smile grew larger, as he called out.

Mama, Will and Clare are here. He didnt give his mother time to answer back as he jumped out of the second story window. He landed with a small thud, but no damage was done.

Clare was the first one out of the car, greeting the young boy with a smile.
My, David. You sure are hyper today. Is 88 awake yet then?
Davids smile faded away to disappointment.
No, hes still sleeping. David followed Clare to the back passenger door. She opened the door to reviling Will in a leg cast. His face a little green with fear. Clare narrowed her eyes. 
Im not that bad of a driver you back seat troublemaker.
Love you too sweetie. He semi-faked fear and sarcasm in his voice. Wills glassy eyes landed on 23, who made his presence known.
Aw, is Will ok?
Yeah 23, I am fine. Will started to move his way out of the car, as Clare disappeared to go to the trunk. She pulled out some crutches.
My name is David! D A V I D!  The boy pouted.
Ah my bad. Will supported himself on the car, as Clare gave him his transportation help.
Mamas up taking care of 88. She told me that shell meet us in the living room.
David ran up to the front door, as if forgetting that Will was handicapped. Clare walked at a slower pace, to keep Will near her. A small smile fell on her face.

I have something to ask.
Yeah. He said, not really paying attention.
Will you marry me?
Will smiled. For some reason, he wanted to say a joke. But his rational side took over.
Yes. Any set dates?
Sometime before the Baby is born. She kept on walking, as Will stopped dead in tracks.
What!! The word was almost silent, as he felt butterflies dance in his chest. He as full of joy and shock, and sometime in the near future, he was going to be a father. 
Im going to be a dad.oh my GOD!! Will hobbled a little bit quicker, to get up to Clare in a faster pace.
I love you.
Love you too, you idiot, now slow down or else we are back at the hospital.
Tsk, calling your future husband an idiot. Not even married yet and your abusing me verbally.

Before they had known it, they made it to the front door. Terri stood waiting, looking at the two like she was watching some sappy love movie.
Need I get you two a room before the end of the day? She joked.
Both blushed and said No in unison.

David looked up at his mother, tugging on her arm.
Mama, Im going to go wait for 88 to wake up. Get me when its dinner please.
Alright David, take it easy now. Terri smiled.
Will watched as the boy ran up the stairs. 
Since when did he start eating? Also, is he growing?
Terri nodded. He is and I cant explain it. Blood is even running his system again.
Terri turned her attention back to Will and Clare.
Whatever Jeremy did, effected the entire system.

David listened as much as he could, before disappearing into another room. The room was painted blue, almost matching the sky on a clear day. 88 lay on a white sheeted bed, unmoving. David jumped on the bed, crawling towards 88s shoulder. The boy laid his head down, and fell asleep wishing. Wishing that his friend would wake up soon, so he could tell him of his time with mother. To tell him how big he has grown. To tell him what ice cream tasted like. Wishing that 88 would open his eyes.

88s bandaged hand twitched. Reaching out once again, to something not there.

******************************************************

Wake up, you have to. You arent like me, so wake up.
Damn it, Answer me!!
You have a reason, my reason is waiting.
Wake up, wake up.

******************************************************

Shut up.
What? You still there.
No, Im just getting irritated. I now know why you dont answer sometimes.
Tsk, I can be so annoying sometimes.

******************************************************




Chapter Twelve
Blue painted the sky. White clouds danced along with it, as birds glanced along with the wind. 88s eyes left the scenery, when a man grabbed his attention away from the view. 88 eyes widened. His striking green eyes, held a hidden sadness. 88 turned and smiled sheepishly.

You must be Jeremy. His voice was soft, guilt lingered within.
I am. He replied with disappointment.

88 looked down at the ground. His body wasnt damaged in this pristine world, but it felt like it was damaged by the look the other man was giving him. Jeremy walked closer to 88, stopping just short of knocking into him. The height difference was still noticeable, even if only a few years had gone by.

Why are you looking down? Jeremy asked.
Arent you mad at me? 88s moved his gray eyes up to meet Jeremys green ones.

A soft smile fell on the youths face.
How could I be mad at you? I programmed you after all. Jeremy walked past 88, making his way to a gated ledge.
Im just sad. I was hoping to see Justice again.

88 looked at the mans back. He seemed so distant, even if he was just a few feet away. 88 then looked around, noticing it was just him and Jeremy. Justice, who was with him since the beginning, was now nowhere to be found. Had he passed on at the death of his sister? 88 looked down at his hands as realization hit him . The person who killed 00, wasnt 88. It was Justice. Had his soul moved on with Sarahs?

Justice was here. 88 spoke, walking to join Jeremy on the ledge. He rested on it, looking at the brunet haired man.

He was guilty that he dragged you into this mess. 88 said softly.
If he hadnt, you would have been a different program all together. Jeremy said back firmly, his eyes never leaving the scenery below him.

Have you always been here? 88 asked, unsure of to ask next.
No. But somehow, I am here now.
And just by looking at me, you knew I wasnt Justice?

Jeremy glanced up at 88. 
You may both have the same body, but your souls are different.
88 straitened in shock. 
Souls? So, I do have one after all?
Jeremy smiled. Its in the program I made for you. For you to learn about life. To learn to become a human. But just dont chock it up to a program, it was only the starting point.

88 looked at his hands. Is that why I am like this. But what about the others? Like 23? I know you werent even born then.
Jeremy looked over at the man, pointing a finger out like it was a secrete. A smile graced his face.
That my friend, is where you come in. I made you a center point. Where other models around you, happen to gain some human emotion. Far beyond what they are programmed with. After that, those who came around you, could also pass on the gift I gave to you.

88 narrowed his eyes. A small frown graced his face, but not of sadness, just irritation.
So, basically, Im a virus.
In a less romantic way about it, yes. Jeremy laughed.

The men looked out at the scenery below. Watching the wind moved the trees back and forth. The smell of grass filled the air. Jeremy hummed a tune that was familiarly to him. 88 closed his eyes, it was nostalgic, but not from Justices memory, but 88s.

So, where are you going now? You cant stay here forever. 88 opened his eyes, a smile graced his face when gray eyes fell on matching ones.
I aint gotta place to go to. And I lost my way along time ago. So I guess wander around. Jeremys eyes never leaving the trees below him. A soft knock to the head shocked him. The words spoken left him speechless.

I told you, aint isnt a word. And you gotta place to go, ya brat.
88 cracked up laughing.
I was wondering when you were going to show up Justice. I knew you wouldnt leave me that easily.
Justice was on the opposite end, resting a hand on the younger person. In a quick flash, Jeremy tackled Justice to the ground. A large umph escaped the older mans mouth.

I take it you missed me? Justice cracked up. Jeremy let go rather quickly, and sat up embraced.
I take it that I am rather mad at you.  He hissed as he crossed his arms.
88 looked down at the two, unsure if he should mention that the two looked like Will and Clare when having a lovers spat, but decided against it. 88 turned his gaze away, his mind full of questions he knew that wouldnt be able to answer. Still, he wanted to try.

So, how long will you two be here? You know, in my mind.? He gave a sarcastic laugh, while tapping his head. In all truth and honesty, 88 would feel lonely if they were to go.

Justice looked up and smiled. Resting his elbows on his knees. His expression unreadable.

Im sorry 88, but, this is the last time we will see each other. At least in this life anyways.

Jeremy looked on, confused.

In this life? You mean there IS a Heaven.

Justice cracked up.

Not really sure, I do know there is a Hell. Just got done with it. Justice got up, offering his hand to Jeremy. So, lets go find out if Heaven will let us in, since I know Hell wont want us.
Jeremy took it, as the older man pulled him up.

The two men walked away from 88. 88 waved, his heart pounding. Justice looked back at his former self. The smile graced a crossed his lips.

Dont do anything I wouldnt do. He half joked.
88 smiled back, knowing what Justice meant in those words.
Jeremy laughed.
Well, dont do anything crazy now 88. You have a soul after all.
The two started to fade away. 88 called out, in one last true good bye.
I want you to know my name. My name isnt 88.ITs

A loud noise smashed through the peaceful world. The colorful green and blue, faded away to white, then gray. Black was the last thing 88 saw before falling into the endless darkness. A small spark caught his attention as he fell. He reached out for it.

				Error 12

******************************************************

So, I guess this is it. I am alone now.
There is no one left for me to tell them my name.
Is this the pain of loss?
Even if there is no one to tell my name to.
I will still call it out in the darkness.
My name is.


******************************************************


88 reached his hand out, clasping his hand in thin air. His gray eyes slowly opened. They scanned the area around him, not making much movement due to the fact that he felt weak. Not the broken type of weak he was use to, but of the exhausted kind. He let his extended arm fall slowly. 88 looked down at the warm heavy feeling holding his shoulder down. A smile fell on his soft face, when he noticed David sleeping on him. The thought crossed his mind that this David was the soul of 23. Not the soul of the David who he originally was. But 88 wasnt going to tell him that. David to himself was David, nothing more. The boy sleeping next to him was like a brother, his only link to the real world.

He closed his eyes, trying to find out where he was. He knew he was safe and he was sure if David was here so was his mother. But he was more worried about Will and Clare, after all they are human. Also, what had allude him was Justice taking his body over for a short moment to kill 00. Had Sarah taken over her own body at that moment, wanting to be free?

88s frustration was getting to him. All these questions with no clear answers. Is this what it means to be human? If so, then that means hed better get use to it. 88 pondered on what those Taxs Will kept talking about. 88 also liked the idea of politics, considering Will ranted about that too. Then again Will ranted about everything. This was driving him nuts, thinking to himself like this. So 88 spoke.

Hey, you awake yet? Your killing my arm. He spoke rather soft. His mouth was strangely dry. 88 watched as he saw the boy stir. Slowly at first, as if waking from a long dream. Then in one go, the boy was very hyperactive.

88, your awake. David fell on top of him, giving him a tight hug. 88 took a sharp breath. His ribs till being sore from the battle. 88 pat his back.

Yeah yeah, but I wont be for long if you dont get off me. He joked.
David shot up, but very careful not to make any damages to his friends body. He looked at 88, a reassuring smile came. 
Im so glad your awake. When we found you, you were a real mess. It took awhile for mama to fix you.
88 closed his eyes, relaxing in the nice warm bed. It was nice to see out of two eyes again.
I bet it did. How long has it been? Since Ive been down?
David straighten out, and crossed his legs. Resting both hands in his face.
Two weeks almost. He sang out. David jumped off the bed, running to the door. Im going to get mama to look at you real quick. If you feel better, theres a place I want to show you.

88 shakily pushed himself up in the bed. His red hair was long enough to drape over his eyes now. With his less damaged hand, he played with his long bangs. His hair had grown like this before, but not this fast. His body was human again, human to an extant. 88 moved his hand away, retracting the blade in his right arm. 88 flinched a bit, pain flared in his arm where the pristine blade came from. Blood was little, but not much. It seemed to him, his hybrid body was adapting itself. A knock on the door made him retract the blade rather quick.

Im awake. He answered.

The door opened. Terri walked in, her graying hair seemed less dominated. In her hand, was a medical kit. Clare followed close behind her. 88 smiled when he saw her, if she was alive, so was Will.

Good afternoon.88?  Terri questioned, unsure if to call him that, or to call him Justice.

Hello, Terri, Clare. I take it Will is fine since you are here?

Clare nodded. A smile fell on her face as she rested her hands on her hips. 

Its nice to see you again. And Will is doing alright, hes downstairs. Hes still recovering from learning hes going to be a father.

88 smiled. A father, thats wonderful. His gray eyes shined with something Clare had never seen before. It was life inside the dead body. No, a living body. Then his features changed to curiosity.
How did he become a father?

Clare nearly busted up laughing, as Terri seemed to roll her eyes as she made her way to 88. The whole atmosphere felt normal, in the most un-normal situations. Terri sat on the bedside taking 88s wrist, feeling his pulse. The once cold waxy pale skin, now was now warm and flesh colored. Terri smiled moving her hand away.

Your pulse is beating slower then most people, but other then that not much to worry about. Terri moved on over to the stethoscope. Placing the cold metal on the mans naked chest. 88 took a sharp breath, little shocked by the numbness that took over. Terri looked up.

You ok?

Yeah, just cold. Its interesting. 88 knew what it was to be cold, but back then it didnt effect him much. Like the effect of the warm bed, verses that of a metal box in which he was stored in. After Terri was done listening, she put her things away. She got up, grabbing some clothing out of the dresser.
Ive had this clothing around for ages, so its a little outdated. If you could please dress in these and join us downstairs, we can talk more freely among the group.

88 narrowed his eyes. The tone of voice reminded him of her days working at the company. 88 turned his head away, noticing the window just out of eye sight. There was some questions he could get out of Terri, more so since she was the only living person who was part of the main five.

Id like that, since I didnt get everything questioned by Justice.

Justice? Clare blinked confused. She had heard 00 say that name, but was really unsure of who that person was.
You knew of him? That he was originally you? Terri frowned, saddened by that realization. She wondered how much 88 had known.
88 sighed heavily. We will all talk in a bit. I need to get ready. He was just hinting to be alone. Terri nodded, grabbing Clare by the arm.
Take all the time you need, there is no rush. She said with a more relaxed tone, one that put 88s worries to rest.

With the shutting of the door, 88 slowly moved in the bed. Taking the white sheets around him, pushing them away. He draped his legs over the bed, gently touching the soft carpeted ground with his feet. Slowly pushing himself up, shakily making his way to the clothing Terri left out for him. His finger tips traced the black and green checkered colored shirt. The pants, a dark black with zippers for pockets. He looked at it with awe, since his awakening in the company, all he wore was black leather clothing. Be it that the clothing in front of him had black, it was something different. 88s mind wandered if Justice had worn clothing like this. He had some memories, but not all. 88 pulled the clothing off the dresser getting ready to fight a new battle. Which was how to get clothing on.

******************************************************

Will looked up from the couch he was sprawled on, to the ceiling above. A large thud seemed to amuse him up stairs. He chuckled a bit, as he turned his attention towards the two woman sitting a crossed from him. David was nowhere to be found.

So, you think hes doing ok up there? Seems to me hes having a hard time. Will laughed at the mental picture that formed in his head.
Terri drank her coffee, relaxed in the whole situation. He has to learn to dress himself. Its not like it was back then, when he was technically a doll for people to dress up.
Clare leaned forward, still left out in the loop. After all, she had just recently been cleared to be in higher levels of the work force, but didnt see much other then 85s rescue from the company.

So, with all that information we put into the models and we didnt teach them to dress themselves?

Will coughed to clear his throat. There was other things to worry about then dressing them, unless they are made to be used for dress up. Will turned his head, when footsteps entered his hearing view. He glanced up, a big smile crossed his face.

Well, well. Isnt it sleeping beauty.

88 was holding tightly to the railing of the staircase. The world around him was old, yet new at the same time. A frustrated frown graced his face.

I dont get it, I use to jump off of building higher then this, why am I so reluctant to go down stairs?  His feet below him felt like lead weights. He gave up trying to make his way down the staircase, choosing to sit on the ledge instead.

You need help off that tower? Dear Rapunzel? Will cracked, not losing his sense of humor after the adventure of life and death.

Terri looked on, more annoyed then amused by Wills antics. Clare smiled, already use to his humor. 88 looked down from his perch, giving Will the death glare.

Shut up, Id like to see you come up here gimpy.

Will gave a sour look. You little

Enough children. Terri snapped.

Yes mother. Both men called out in unison, railing up Terris irritation.

On with our early discussion. How do you know of Justice?

Wills head snapped up, his joking face faded away to shock. His eyes fell on 88, who was leaning on the railing. This was something he hadnt expected.

Terri spoke again. Her attitude not changing.

I know your not Justice, youre a new person all together 88. As my son David, he is as well a different person. Her face softened. Still, regardless, I dont know how either of them could forgive me.

88 glanced over at the older woman, his eyes glazed with sadness. David could never hate you. Even beyond the program you made for him, he felt something for you. I can assure you, it wasnt hate. 88 took a breath, breathing in a sweet smell. It just took me to override the system of 23, for his real persona to take over.
Clare was to far lost in the conversation, but Will seem to follow on every word. For Terri it was also a relief.

I was wondering what Jeremy had done differently with you. Will sighed as he broke his silence. He had known more then he let on, but playing under radar was his game. It kept him alive.

Terri nodded. Yes, Jeremy was rather crazy when Justice showed up on the factory floor dead. We did have an eye on Jeremy, but it was mainly under Gregs orders.

88 spoke bitterly. So it was that bastard who made me kill him. He was disgusted. The created killing his creator, such irony. Anger built up thinking it was Rod whod ordered the kill.

Will nodded, moving his body to get more relaxed with his leg.
Jeremy was to overworked, he didnt stay low like he did before. Justice was also laying low before he was killed. The three of us had a plan to expose the corporation. But with Justice and Jeremy dead, I knew I couldnt do it alone. Will hid his face in his hands. I didnt do anything because I was afraid I would be killed next.

Clare knew Will had worked there longer then herself, but she hadnt known how deep he was in. How much had he hid from her to protect her, as well as getting strings pulled to save her life. Will was a man who worked in the shadows, be it selfish.

Will, anyone would be afraid in that situation. Your human instinct told you to survive and you did. 88 got up, attempting to make his way down the stairs again.
 Besides, you where under heavy surveillance. I was even commanded to keep an eye on you.

This whole things a mess. Clare blurted out. Why was even this company started in the first place? Ive read the history of it, but still nothing makes sense.

Terri lowered her head. The company was made out of the boredom of people who had money. People who wanted to be Gods. People who knew of no consensuses. We all had our reasons. My own, was to erase my mistake. Need I say more? The more part could have gone on if Terri wanted to be truly technical about it.

Clare wanted to say more, but knew it would be getting nowhere. Clare had knowingly joined the corporation due to the pay. She had also played the game of God, dismissing any morels that should have stopped her from doing so. She sat down, still full of emotions. 88 by that time, had made his way to the couch Will was currently sitting on. He sat down rather hard, almost simple mindedly forgetting about Wills leg.

Hey man, watch it. Will knocked 88 in the arm. 88 narrowed his eyes.
You watch it, my arms just as fucked up as your leg.

Clare and Wills mouth opened in shock. 88 had said a cussword. Clare looked over at Will, wondering what other words the man taught him. Will got the look from her, the type of look of not teaching your future children those words. Will chuckled a bit.
88 looked around for the brunet boy.
Where is David by the way?

Terri smiled. Glad for the change of subject. Hes in the kitchen, hes taken a liking to cooking.
Ah, so thats that nice smell I smelt earlier. 88 said heartily. Then, without warning, a large rumbling noise escaped his stomach. 88s eyes widened.
What the hell was that?

Clare smiled wickedly. Oh dear, looks like you got a monster in there.

What, humans get monsters in their stomachs? This was something new to him. 88 was almost for the loss of words. His eyes grew large. 88 regretted not getting Justice knowledge of the human body. 

Will chuckled. Yeah, theres one in Clares right now. Thats going to pop out one day.

88 looked rather scared. His mind couldnt, didnt want to imagine that. The trio laughed at 88s confused fear. The red head frowned, oblivious that he was a butt of a joke.

Lets go to the kitchen, David cooks more then enough for two people. So its free pickings in the fridge. Terri got up, showing the two walk able people the way. Will sighed, little angered he had to get up. He wasnt going to argue, it was better then Hospital food. Will tried pushing himself up, but had some problems getting out of the over plush cushions.

Hey, 88. Give me a hand will you.
The red head stopped at the entrance to the door to the kitchen. In his view point, he could see David cooking happily over the stove. Terri grabbing the dishs, while Clare raided the fridge. A smiled crossed his face as he turned his back to the kitchen light, making his way back to Will. Will raised an eye brow, not to sure of the grin that graced his face. The red head extended his hand down to the other man.

I have a name other then 88, you know.

Will relaxed, understanding in a way to what that smile meant now. Will took his hand, little taken back by the younger mans strength and speed while pulling him up.

Really? What is it?

My name is

******************************************************

So, I guess this is it. I am alone now.
There is no one left for me to tell them my name.
Is this the pain of loss?
Even if there is no one to tell my name to.
I will still call it out in the darkness.
My name is.

Chapter Thirteen
Im headed out mom. Nixin called out from the red sports car he was leaning on. His red hair seemed unruly with the fall wind blowing. The orange and brown hue of the area was majestic, as the leaves fell slowly.  Terri walked out with a mini-laptop in hand. Her mind preoccupied with something else.

Make sure you buy Duck, or else David will kill you. She said with a hint of malice. Her once gray hair was now dyed brown. Her eyes never leaving the screen as she made her way back into the house. David ran by, dodging his mother with easy. He leaned on the balcony railing.

And dont forget the cooking chocolate!! He was now taller and stronger looking. His childish feature remained, but a more teenage appearance was showing through.

Yeah, yeah. Its on the list Nixin complained, as he sat heavily in the car. He was a little annoyed that David wasnt old enough or tall enough yet to drive. Nixin felt a little uneasy at that thought, David driving. If the boy hadnt been dead before, he was sure he would have been dead learning to drive.

Nixin went for his mp4 player in the car, and raised the music before heading out to the freeway. His gray eyes eyed the speed gage, wanting to go faster then he was aloud to. He sighed in defeat, knowing there was a snake in the grass hiding out a mile ahead. He had to play it safe, at least this time around. A wicked smile fell on his face.

Next time he could block the signals video and radios of the police car, but for the moment, food was the main objective. Nixin liked food, among other things.

******************************************************

Nixin waited in the long line, board out of his mind. Thanksgiving weekend, it was a pain but nothing compared to Christmas. He swore that he would never again walk into a store for that month. Seeing parents beat each other up over toys that would end up discarded later on by their children. Nixins expression turned sour when he recalled Will franticly trying to buy the latest kids toy that people deemed must have of the year. A small smile fell on his face though, knowing the gift Will gave his daughter was a special one. Even if Clare told him not to buy it, he did. Their daughter, Mia, was ridiculously cute. Large wide eye, curly hair, basically a mini-girl version of Will, with Clares attitude. 

The line moved, causing his thoughts to change. More random and normal thoughts most people would have with no worries. It didnt take long, before Nixin noticed he was being watched. Yes, it had been almost been six years since he moved into the normal life, but his old days as 88, stayed with him. He acted cool, trying to find out who was watching him without being caught. His gray eyes found a mirror above him, he glanced up, not moving his head in the process. The persons image reflected back to him, with a kind smile. Nixin blinked not really knowing who she was but in a why, knew who she was. The woman had known he spotted her, she was waiting for him to do so. He made his way to the cashier and paid for his items. He then turned making his way to the woman.

With paper bags in hand, he stopped short. The woman was very familiar, her flat blond hair and sparking blue eyes. The white of her skin.

Well, are you going to stand there like an idiot staring at me all day or are you going to say something?
Im sorry?

She said, rather annoyed he couldnt place her. The woman crossed her arms as she started to walk outside. She gestured him to follow her. Nixin wasnt uneasy around her, so he followed without fear. The woman made her way to a coffee shop, taking a seat at an outside table. Nixin took his bags, setting them down at the side. He took the seat across from her.

So, you dont recall me then? Its me, 85. She pointed to herself. Well, its Ashley now. She said with a big grin.
Nixins face fell to shock. 
I remember you now. The last time I saw you, Clare was taking you away. It seems your doing well.
Ashley smiled. Resting her face in her left hand. Her cerulean blue eyes gazed at a diamond ring around her wedding finger. 
I am, living somewhat of a normal life. Considering my conception


Nixin nodded in agreement and a common understanding. He was about to say something when a waitress came by. The two ordered their drinks and lunch before talking away like old friends.

Ashley glanced back over to the red headed man.
So I take it, your no longer called 88?
No, its Nixin now. But to others like banks and what not, Im still Justice.
Oh, how so? Why I mean? She was rather curious. Nixin smiled like a rich nut, pointing over to his car.
Well, Justice had a lot of money saved up. Along with Rods money. Those two combined have set me off rather well. I dont have to work a day in my life and then some.
Ashley frowned over jealousy, even if the names Justice and Rod didnt mean anything to her.
Lucky, I have to work to pay the rent where my fianc and I live.
Nixin glanced over at the ring. Making a mental note she was taken.
Well, congrats. Whens the wedding?
Next year, hes going to pay for that.
The drinks came, as did the food. The waitress left as just a passing memory.

Nixin looked over at the gold colored park. He wanted to ask something of Ashley, but he didnt want to sound cruel, not to another ex-Model like himself. He had to ask in the end either way.

Ashley. When did you become aware of your own existence?

Silence was between the two. Only the wind and birds passed between them. The woman took a deep soft breath.

I dont really remember. I do know, that I am not the real Ashley. She put her hands in her lap. Her expression grew sad. Her family even knew that I wasnt their Ashley. But they treated me as if I was their daughter.   

Nixin felt guilty bringing up the subject. He took a sip of some sweet drink, a small memory of white chocolate flashed in his mind.

How did you know, that you werent the real Ashley? He had wondered if her time of being 85, if she too, met her former self.

Ashley looked up at the ever changing sky. She rested her hands on her heart and closed her eyes to recall. 
The real Ashley was right here, protecting me from what was done to me. She was a very kind soul and would hide me away when I got scared.

Hide you away?

Yes. She took me into her memories. Where her mother and father loved her dearly. It was a lake house that was most special to her, so it was there where I was safe. She opened her eyes. But mother and father had to sell it. After all, a daughter who was dead came back to them. Many people would find that strange, so they sold everything and left within a week of my return.

Nixin smiled. Well, Im glad they took you back. More glad that you are adapting well.

Well, you yourself seem to have adapted well. Then again, I am not to sure how we adapted in the first place. She was a little confused about that, Nixin busted up laughing.

Yeah, about that, it was me. I was programmed with a virus to somehow override the original programs given to us. Im still not to sure about how it works, because my programmer is long dead. But what ever he did, we are here now.

Ashley looked deadpanned. Youre a virus huh? That would explain some things. A ringing sound disturbed the two. Ashleys face lit into a smile. She opened her cell phone up, striking a conversation rather quickly.
Nathan, sorry sweetie, I ran into an old friend. Ill be home soon. Love you too. She gave a kissing sound and hung up. Nixin looked at her and smiled.

How cute.
Ashley blushed.
Oh, shut it will you. She went for her purse to pay the bill, but Nixin offered to pay for it. There was no protest on the other end but a quick thank you followed. 
Ill also pay for your wedding as well. He said rather normally.
Ashley stopped short, before breaking into a big grin, grabbing the ex-model in a death hug. You made my Day!! Thank you. She pulled away returning to her purse for some paper.

The two exchanged phone numbers, before Ashley started sprinting off. Nixin smiled as he stayed sitting at the table. It was turning out to be an eventful day. He looked over at Ashleys discarded food, it was calling out to him. Waste not, want not, so he helped himself. It amazed him on how fat he didnt become with all the junk food he ate.

He took a lovingly bite, as he hummed to himself. His eyes closed for a quick moment, before narrowing down onto a target. In the distance was a man. He looked rather clean shaven, age around 65ish. It was the way that he stood, gave off as a shady character. One that set signals off in Nixin. He knew that face, it was a face he saw while investigating Sarahs unsolved murder. The mans name, Michael Brown.  He had been in jail for raping a child. One that they knew of, but because of a fucked up justice system he was let go,. To prey once again on young children. Nixin was sure of it, that he was one of the men that killed Sarah. Starting a chain of events that lead him to be who he was now. 

He ate his food slowly, keeping a steady view on the man. When the man started to move away from his eye sight, did Nixin get up to follow. He left a $100, telling the waitress to keep the change. He made his way in the almost empty food court. So close, yet far away. Nixin so wanted to take action right there but there was still to many people. 

Nixin stopped when he heard the mans cell ring. The man picked it up, calling out an even more familiar name. Ricky, he called him. So it was Rick Santos, he had been arrested for drug dealing. He was talking to the other man who helped killed Sarah. The man started walking again, this time away from the lingering people around him. Nixin followed soon after. 

Nixin leaned on the brick wall, seeing the man go down the ally way. Nixin laughed at how such a fitting end was coming to this man. Michael was still talking to the man on the other side of the phone before he started to lose connection.

Rick, can you hear me? Hello? The older man hissed when he heard static on the other end. The line was dead. The man looked at his cell phone, angered at the technologies frailer. He gave up dialing after a few time and placed the cell back into his pocket. He resumed his walk deeper into the ally way, cutting his way deeper into the world in which he thought he was safe.

The darkening sky hit the automatic lights to flicker on, bathing the black way in orange spots. Michael seemingly knew his way around the area. He also assumed he was alone, that was until he heard footsteps echoing behind him.

Michael pulled out a butterfly knife he had hidden in the cuff of his pants. The blade swung out with ease. The old man looked around him, ready for a fight. The lone light that shown on him, didnt give away the intruder around him. 

Whos there? If you dont come out, Ill find and kill you. He called out in the dark. The knife reflecting back at the world around him.

Silence came in return. Michaels ears strained to hear any receding or advancing footsteps. Nothing. A loud crashing noise behind him made him jump backwards, ready to thrash if needed. The sound of a cat hissing and running away threw his guard off. The sound of a lone trash can lid, echoed off the wall.

Fucking cat.

Michael was starting to wonder if it was just his own footsteps he was hearing. He sling the blade back but didnt return the knife back to his cuff. He sighed a breath of relief, before laughing to himself a bit. He started to walk back to the way he was going, when his pace abruptly stopped. The man stayed standing in one spot, not moving.  Then, in slow motion, he fell to his knees. Once the heavy thud of knee hitting concrete, Michaels head came off, rolling into the darkness. The body slumped forward, with blood pooling around the only source of an exit.

Nixin walked out of the darkness. A pristine bloody blade extended from his arm. A red vertical line, where the blade had been retracted from marked his skin. He stopped at Michaels twitching body, kneeling down to grab the cell out of his back pocket. He smiled a bit as he spoke to the dead corpse.

It took me awhile to find you. But it was worth it. He hummed to himself. Nixin retracted the blade back into his arm. The once red line, faded away back to normal skin color. He flexed his hand, feeling the blood rush back to his arm.

Nixin flicked the cell phone open, seeing a list of names and numbers on the tiny machine. A new hit list for him to play with. If anything, Nixin wanted to go for Rick next, then after that he could go after the others or turn them in. He sighed at the decisions in life. He snapped the cell shut before looking up at the street light that shined down. His gray eyes reflected back.

One down, one to go. He put the cell in his own back pocket, vanishing as quickly as he arrived.

******************************************************

Nixin parked the car at the house. He got out, shutting the car door with ease. He made his way up the walk way, stopping short of the stair way. He glanced up, seeing a very upset David.

Uhhi? Nixin crocked out. He had forgotten the time, something he had not grown use to. Even if the dark starry sky told him otherwise.

Davids frown matched his growing anger. It was rather hard for Nixin to keep a straight face, seeing David in a frilly apron with a mixing bowl and wooden spoon in hand.
Your late. Where is the food? He said dead panned. 

Nixin swore he could hear Terris voice in that son of hers. Nixin swallowed hard, his mouth tasted like sandpaper. He had forgotten it at the coffee shop while he went after Michael. He started smiling, out of fear.

Uh He pointed to the car. I left it, its in the back seat, let me go get it. Nixin started to walk away, back in the direction in which he came. Quickening his pace.

David smiled. Not catching on to the lie. Good! I was afraid you had forgotten, after all, the stores are closed tomorrow. David started to walk back into the house, when he heard the car engine start. The teens green eyes grew huge, then flared in anger. He did a 180. Seeing the red tail lights vanish into the darkness. David started raging as he called out. He ran back outside, gritting his teeth.

Nixin, you IDIOT! He waved the wooden stick, like one would wave a potential weapon. He fumed on the porch for awhile, mixing away on the cake batter. He sighed, knowing when Nixin came back, he would have the food. He walked back into the house, where Terri was sitting reading a book. She glanced up, smiling a bit at her son.

He forget the food again? Something that was obviously a recurring occurrence.
What do you think. David walked into the kitchen, seeing his mother crack a smile.
Thank god I already bought the food yesterday. She went back to reading her book. The kitchen door flew open, with David hugging his mother in a flash.
Love you MOM. He got up rather quick, heading back to the kitchen with the same speed.
Terri cracked a smile. Once again returning back to her book. Nixin owed her big time but since it was the holidays, shed let him slide.

******************************************************

Nixin looked at the Closed Sign. His forehead rested on the cold glass. His reflection showing his enthusiasm. 

David is going to kill me. He closed his eyes in defeat, heading once again to his car. Ready to face whatever came his way. For Nixin, he didnt want it any other way. It was a place to call home, in the crazy world he lived in. Before leaving, he cracked a smile and wondered if anyone found the body yet.

END of NUMBER 88 

Notes from me:

Well its the end of this short 13 chapter book my family and friends. I can tell you, it didnt end they way I had planned it. Either way, I am glad it still ended the way it did. Now, most are wondering, how did I think of this story? Well, it started when I was working at a kitchen hospital, I had to clean dishes and what not. But while cleaning, I saw a number on the washing machine, the number was 88. After that, I thought Id want to make a story out of something with the number 88 in it. It took me awhile, 2007, to think of what to write. It wasnt until the end of 2008 did I start to write the story. Yes, it took awhile to write it, but its done. Well, any way, I would like to thank my family, who supports my writing style, even if a little dark, and I am sure going to help me pay for this book. My friends, who Ive dragged with me to hell and back while writing this story. Two teachers in middle school, whom I will forever thank in my heart for giving me a push towards writing. And at last, but not least, the friends I have made online from all over the world. Everyone here, has given me inspiration to write my stories, and I assure you, there will be more to come. Please look forward to many other stories, the next book I am working on will be Reality Wakes. It has a different writing style, but still you can tell its been written by me. Hope to see everyone with the next one to come around, and I promise, it wont take as long as Number 88 has been. 

Now, I hope you all taken my first story with a grain of salt, as I am nor professional writer. I just write for fun and to share the stories with others. Now for a note to future book writers, dont give up. Just keep on writing, I am sure you will find your own story writing style. Keep your mind open and dream.

I will miss you characters, as I have grown to care for you. There is never a true goodbye, because I am sure, I will see you again some day. Because there are always prequels and sequels to play with.  

Thank you everyone, once again for reading.
