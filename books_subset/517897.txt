Mirrors

Ishmael Bodd woke up at 11.52 in the morning of Tuesday 13 April 2B101M002,192. He felt different but, at first, had no idea what had changed.
But something had fundamentally changed. Within hours, he would break the law, something no Citizen had done in his thousand years of life, and begin to run.
***
At 11.53 am, he stared out of the Newspapers panoramic window, at the Marstoo landscape, and felt something:
Not like the clones paradise on Earthtoo. Ilike the red sunset and the distant row of red hills, the endless expanse of Marstoo Supercity, stretching as far as those hills. It feels like home.
In fact, his nice, quiet house was out there, at the foot of those hills. A tiny, two-seat wind-copter scudded across the Regulation four-storey buildings. Nothing ever changed there and that was just the way he liked it.
But something had changed; he had been talking to himself.
The sensation felt strange.
He returned his attention to his monitor, to the small column article he had been writing for the next days issue and saw the chip, a tiny piece of ceramic and rare metal, on his desk. He studied its maze-like surface and picked out some silver lettering down the side. Turning the chip, he read; C199989 Single. No offspring.
Now I understand!
Again, the words in his head disturbed him but he felt slightly reassured that he had found an explanation; he had gone through an RB and been patched up.
RBs; Reality Breakdowns  instances in time where all reality structures breakdown locally, often in areas of less than ten square metres. All affected Citizens require patching up; a C-chip replacement by a qualified medical officer. But nobody knows why we need our C-chip, the Control chip, replaced.
Putting the chip in his pocket, he looked up the word like in an archive lexicon of the once-universal language, Basic, accessible only to journalists who wrote on history and archaeology, as he sometimes did. He found the verb:
 
Like - toenjoydoingsomething,ortofeelthatsomeoneorsomethingis pleasantorattractive. Disused.

Disused; that means it has no more use.
He remembered the chip and the three words; Single. No offspring. It suddenly irked him that he had always been single and had no offspring. Why should it be so? He had a girlfriend and he would see her tonight.
Altogether, a lot of things suddenly seemed out of place and disjointed. He felt uncomfortable. He forced himself to focus and flipped on the morning news bulletin. The level voice announced:

You remember the discovery, a few weeks ago, by an archaeological team on Earthone, of the very earliest hominid ever found; 5.4 Million years BC in the ancient Kenya region. We can report that traces of intact DNA have been found, analysed and have the distinctive tensi of very early clone hominids; molecule strings hanging off DNA strands, which form the letters MC  the Made by Citizens tag. This is yet again indisputable proof that Citizens existed before clones.

The following bulletins didnt interest Ishmael so he turned it off, quickly transmitting a reminder note to write something on the discovery for the Thursday edition. For the next forty minutes, he looked through any historical publications he could find for pictures of Citizens before his time. The pictures were the same he remembered as a minor; a family on a picnic, a brave explorer scaling a sheer cliff, a speedboat pilot careering around a race circuit, a model tossing her glossy, russet hair for the camera. The pictures looked familiar and yet they looked strange.

***
When the buzz sounded for lunch, Ishmael immediately headed for the Mall. He never visited the Mall but he needed to escape from the office. Everything looked strange to him. His eyes took everything in but his mind became jammed with new sensations. He found himself smiling at two minor Citizens, as they scuttled between the legs of the parents and then ran for a confectionary kiosk. Ishmael helped one of them across a busy intersection and, You have gained one credit, rang up on his retina display.
Ishmael saw a sign, reminding him that; Running is Against the Law for Adult Citizens.
I remember running as a minor. I wonder why it is illegal.
Before he could stop himself, he had broken into a run. He ran past staring Citizens and on, to the travelators that would take him through the long tunnels to the centre of Supercity. Horns blared and Policeman scrambled to pursue him but most were too slow to catch a running Citizen. He turned away from every monitoring device he detected but it hardly mattered; his face looked like a thousand other Citizens and his ID would already have been recorded anyway.
When he reached the next intersection, he reversed course and passed the struggling Policeman going in the other direction.
Before the buzz to mark the end of lunchtime, he had reached his office but he saw a Policeman at the entrance.
Oh oh! Not good! He turned away and headed for the travelator heading towards his home district. His body had begun to feel alien to him and several times, his footsteps faltered, attracting the gaze of other Citizens. On the travelator, he had to take stock. Everything seemed to be happening to him for the first time; as if he had previously been asleep. And yet he knew he had gone to work at the same place and spent his days in exactly the same way for almost a millennium.
When he reached his intersection, he took the travelator, not to his own house, but to that of Yaela, his girlfriend. He had to talk to somebody.
At her neighbourhood, he stepped off and went into the restroom he always used just before walking to her house. He took his comb from his pocket and tidied the hair of his reflection in the mirror. He noted the obligatory blue suit of a worker and the typical, symmetrical and pleasing face of a modern Citizen; each eye almost half the width of the face, a tiny, vestigial nose and a tiny mouth, smaller than each eye at full stretch. His head too had the pleasing egg shape; high forehead and thick hair. As an afterthought, he darkened its tone from blonde to dark brown. He stared at his reflection and wondered who looked back at him.
Yaela came to the door herself and showed her surprise with raised eyebrows:
Ishmael! Youre far too early and lucky Im here! I left work early to tidy up! You had better come in. Have you darkened your hair for me? It looks nice.
Yes.
Looking around for anything suspicious, Ishmael sat gingerly on the lounge sofa and listened as Yaela bustled around, fixing him a toxocharge.
Wont be long darling, she declared, putting the charge into his hands. Just need to tidy the kitchen and make the bed and then Ill be all yours. How did your day go at the office?
Ishmael put the charge to this lips. The novel fizz, when the charge touched his lips, delighted him.
Oh, I forgot to mention, its a new one. Just trying it for the first time. Its called Ion Flux Bright Number One! What do you think?
Mm. Its nice. I wanted to talk to you about your day but I will wait until you are ready.
Oh, dont mind me. You know my job is boring. Yours is the one that interested me!
Ishmael knew Yaela scored very high on the charm scale and her job in government administration to be a very highly paid and important one.
Yaela, I dont feel right, he finally blurted when she had sat down and they had drunk a few more glasses of Number One. Her conversation had been engaging enough but he felt a growing restlessness. When he blurted out his sentence, the corners of her mouth raised in a pleasant smile.
Well, we will have to see what we can do about that, wont we!
Im not ready for sex yet, darling. I mean, something happened today. I feel different. I thinkI know I went through an RB and I found my own C-chip on my desk. I have it here!
He took out the tiny chip and held it out in the palm of his hand. Yaela looked at it, shaking her head.
Youre not supposed to show such things to other people Ish, even your girlfriend! You always were a bit forward. Anyway, RBs will become more frequent now.
Ishmael didnt know what she meant but, putting the chip back in his pocket, he forced a bashful hue to his face and continued:
But I ran in the Mall!
Oh. Why?
I dont know. It seemed likefun!
Another word I have to look up!
Thats bad! Anyway, Ish, you are not making any sense. What is fun? Is it one of those old words clones used?
Maybe. I dont know. I have used several today. I wouldnt mind looking at a few books about the clone way of life now. I dont have access.
Really Ish! Now you are getting too much! That is completely illegal! It is virtually pornography!
Why?
Clones are so dirty. They have organic bodies and eat organic matter and defecate! You cant seriously be interested in them. Look what they did to Earthone!
Not alone. WeCitizens were part of it too in the AH Alliance.
Yaela shook her head. It was before the Alliance. Then she clamped her lips shut. Ishmael could see she wouldnt speak further on such things. Yaela reached out her hand, touched the back of Ishmaels and murmured:
Come on, its time. We can eat after.
Why are you being so nice to me? Ishmael wondered, but he feared the answer. On the mezzanine, he paused to glance out of the window for flashing blue lights. He didnt see any.
Perhaps all this will pass, like a nightmare! But nightmare is another disused word!
Yaela had already stripped off her daygown when he reached the bedroom and lay on the bed with her delicate hands across her chin. Her magnificent breasts never failed to arouse him and she knew they would. He saw the innocence of a child and the awareness of the ultimate seductress in her eyes, both at the same time. She had bewitched him since they had been at school together. Now, yet again, he felt powerless to resist. He lay on top of her and kissed her body while she steadily removed his suit. By the time he lay naked too, his penis almost glowed red and she signalled with her eyes that she felt ready for it. They coalesced in waves of pure electric pleasure, neither of them slowing until they had reached the height of ecstasy and coasted on the waves of its subsidence to a gentle rest.
Together, Yaela mumbled.
What did you say?
Nothing.
A distant wail interrupted Ishmaels contemplation of her secret word but at first, he only felt irritation:
Whats that bloody noise?
Ishmael! You swore. How.
Its a bloody Police siren. I know it is!
Ishmael had already leaped out of the bed and began thrusting on his clothes.
Wait! Yaela protested. Where are you going?
They are coming for me Yaela. I know they are. I told you, I ran in the Mall!
Dont worry. Its just a small fine. It can be fixed! I can talk with my superiors!
But Ishmael hadnt stopped to listen to her. He had already reached the stairs and moments later, he rushed out into the hot night.
***
Ishmael only just made it to the station before a Policedrone came round the corner behind him. But, to his horror, he saw another Policeman watching the platform. He ran into the restroom and stared at himself in the mirror again. He changed his hair colour to black and threw his jacket into a cubicle.
On second thoughts.
He took the chip from the jacket pocket and stuffed it into his shirt pocket. He walked out of the restroom, straight into a Policeman:
You have been recorded running sir. Would you kindly come with me?
It wasnt me. You have the wrong Citizen.
Oh. That must be a mistake then. I apologize. I will have to confirm this with my central database operator.
Fine. I will just go and put my jacket on.
Good.
Ishmael turned round and re-entered the restroom.
I just lied! And I lied to a Policeman. Only clones lie. How did I do that? It must be a major offence! Its not even supposed to be possible for a Citizen! I cant let myself get caught now! They will terminate me prematurely!
A long row of windows lined the restroom wall, near the roof. Ishmael had no trouble climbing onto a washbowl and opening one. He had more of a struggle, squeezing through it but when he dropped to the ground, he saw no Policemen so he ran for the nearest street corner and turned it. 
Ishmael soon ran past a sign that told him he had entered a neighbouring district. He had begun to feel safe but moments later, flashing blue lights in the sky told him this search would not stop. A Police wind-copter swooped down low over the rooftops and shone a spotlight right in his face.  He darted into somebodys garden and climbed a wall but another copter picked him up when he reached the adjoining street. The sound of sirens seemed to surround him.
He reached another street corner by dodging the probing spotlights and saw what he dreaded; Policemen approaching from both directions.
Cornered! Have to think.
Scouring the street for somewhere to hide, he could find nothing. He stared down at the ground to think and found himself looking at the answer. Moments later, the Policemen converged where he had been standing but he had gone.
***
Ishmael had to crawl on his hands and knees in the sewer. He couldnt be sure that the Police bots wouldnt follow him but he guessed they were no designed for such feats of dexterity.
He guessed right. Since the last clones had been quarantined, half a million years before, the Policeman had only to protect Citizens since their charges were unable to break laws. They had never needed to visit the sewers since Citizens would never go there and so Policemen had become less manoeuvrable with time.
Ishmael crawled north though he hardly knew it. The sewers had long been cleansed of any clone filth but they were still dark, damp and full of old, broken pipework and obstructions, all of which presented great risk to a Citizen. The constant dripping of water from the condensation on the tunnel roof began to get into his eyes and ears and his clothes became soaked, making it harder to move. After a few hours, he reluctantly removed his trousers and shirt. He made sure the chip still lay securely in his shirt pocket and wrapped the garment around his waist, before continuing. 
In this way, he crawled north for nearly eleven hours, managing to cover a distance of only one mile. But it looked, as far as he could tell, as if the Police had lost track of him. He badly needed a charge but he could find no charge machines and there could be no restaurants or bars. Many pipes lined the tunnels but when he found breaks, he could see these pipes had once held liquids or still held long-corroded electrical wiring.
It proved lucky for him that he had crawled north, back towards the centre of Supercity because just as he felt he would not be able to continue, he spied a grill in the far distance.
With his last burst of energy before going on reserve, he tore the grill off its hinges and peered into the tunnel beyond. It looked cleaner, bigger and had rails along its bottom; a maintenance duct. He crawled into it and switched to reserve.
He had leaned against the tunnel wall, to consider his next move, when he experienced another RB.
Oh no, now there are no Medical staff to patch me up!
His anxiety turned into what he gradually recognised as anger, one of the few emotions he knew from lessons at school.
Clones suffer from many faulty behaviour patterns, the worst of which are anger, hatred, revenge, jealousy envy, his teacher had told them. Citizens suffer from none of these and we tried to genetically engineer them out of clones but never succeeded. Their emotions are what created the Wars that destroyed Earthone and made their quarantine necessary. They are much happier on their reserves now anyway.
Ishmael wondered how he had survived the RB. He also felt very angry that Reality Breakdowns existed. He remembered who he had been a few moments before and knew that he wasnt quite the same Citizen now. This made him even angrier.
Im not even sure I am a Citizen anymore! he told himself. What am I?
The crackling of electricity and two points of light in the distance interrupted his thoughts. He watched and waited. Within a few minutes, a squat machine ran down the tracks from his right and stopped when it encountered the obstruction of Ishmaels legs.
A Janitor Robot! Ishmael said to himself. I thought they were extinct!
Ishmael realised the Bot would need power and so he withdrew his legs to let the Bot pass and lead him to its source. The Bot scanned the tunnel as it went, occasionally stopping to weld closed a crack in a casing or remake a broken connection with two of its four extending arms. From the display on the Bots top. Ishmael quickly realised that the Bot headed towards known faults, indicated by tunnel shaft-prop numbers, but that it also fixed any other fault it found.
They reached an intersection and the Bot stopped. A thick cable extended from its main body and inserted its jack into a socket on the wall. The Bots readout indicated; Charging: 10%.
When the percentage reached 100%, the Bot withdrew the jack and moved on. Ishmael felt nothing short of revulsion as he leaned forward and placed his mouth around the jack. 4000 A/C volts of lovely, raw power surged into his neck. Visions of clones eating raw vegetable matter and meat leaped into his mind. His revulsion at their eating surpassed even that of his own desperate act.
I wonder how clones can stand it. Such a disgusting imitation of true replenishment.
The Janitor Bot had almost left his sight before he felt fully replenished. He had to hurry to catch up.
***
The maintenance duct proved drier and more spacious than the sewer and, though Ishmael still had to stoop to walk, he soon felt well enough to consider his next move. As he walked behind the Bot, the awful truth of his situation dawned on him. He had to leave Supercity. But he knew of nowhere else exceptClonecity. The thought appalled him but he had no choice. But how to find it. Clonecity had an almost mythical status in his mind. He had never met anybody who had actually seen it, although everyone had seen pictures of it in books and knew what life must be like there; endless expanses of disgusting grass and prairies containing animals! Really! It made him feel ill to think about it. And now he had to find the clones; only they might be able to help him. He knew he would be terminated if caught in Supercity.
But where to go?
 ***
Above ground, Government offices went into overdrive, trying to decide what to do about the absent Citizen, Ishmael Bodd, better known to them as C199989. No Citizen had broken the law for nearly 20,000 years. The systems for dealing with such incidents were no longer understood or functioning properly. Even the legal case against C199989 took time to correctly ascertain; for lying to a Policeman, C199989 would have to be reprogrammed and that would include a new Personality chip or P-chip. He would, in effect, no longer exist. This did not explain his continual attempts to evade the authorities, however.
 Go into the sewers, open up the maintenance tunnels, watch the space port, and the clones! President Armande One ordered. But keep it from the Citizens.
Recriminations followed and heads of offices were dismissed. The recent increase in incidences of RBs had been known about and, therefore, the incident should have been anticipated. Meanwhile, every Policesuperintendent, or PoliceSupers, armed versions of policemen held in storage for more than a millennium, were reactivated and sent to hunt down C199989 along with a company from Supercity Army.
***
What is your assignment? the Janitor Bot suddenly asked.
What? You can speak. What did you ask?
I can receive voice input and issue guidance. You asked where you should go, the Bot replied.
Yes. I did. Can you take me to the clones?
The Bot remained silent, but an icon on the monitor showed it to be processing information. It replied:
Negative. Clones are quarantined.
Oh. Yes. Well, can you take me near to Clonecity?
Affirmative. I will arrive at your requested location in two days. Follow me.
Great! Is it very far then?
Twenty six point two miles.
Cant we go straight there?
I cannot deviate from my primary function.
Ishmael considered tampering with the robot but decided his luck had been too good to try it further.
Oh.
After more than twenty-four hours of trudging through Supercitys bowels, Ishmael and the bot reached much larger tunnels and an intersection, whose roof hung three floors above. Long vertical tubes and ducts met horizontal ones and tracks on the floor guide the occasional maintenance vehicle through complex points. Lights blinked everywhere and the Bot seemed disorientated.
Ishmael looked at the red number fourteen on the Bots top and almost felt affection for it:
Where next, Number Fourteen? he asked.
Location 42988.12.
Oh.
A large vehicle came into view from one of the large tunnels and juddered to a halt. Out leaped six armed figures, holding something in their hands. Ishmael had never seen lasers but he recognised them from pictures. The figures suits were black and five had a yellow flash on their shoulders, the sixth, red. Four figures fanned out into the three other large tunnels while two remained, including the one with the red flash.
Supercity Army, Ishmael whispered.
The two standing figures seemed to spot Ishmael.
You must follow me, the Janitor Bot declared.
Immediately, it retracted its two mechanical arms until they lay flush with its squat body and it rolled into a pipe, no wider than Ishmaels shoulders, which ran under the intersection. The pipe looked too narrow for him to crawl through on his own.
Ishmael had just enough time to grab a bracket on the rear of the Bot before the machine dragged him into the pipe, headfirst.
The pipe snaked between machinery and when Ishmael estimated that they had crossed the intersection, it began to climb in a series of tight turns. The Bot dragged him over loose rubble and joints in the pipe which abraded Ishmaels skin.
They emerged into a tunnel, much like their first one, but it ended in an opening halfway up the intersection walls.
Citizen C199989! Do not resist arrest! a mechanical voice bellowed from below.
Ishmael stood up and saw the team of armed soldiers converging from the other tunnels and heard the steady clang of two metal feet, climbing up a ladder to his tunnel.
The Bot had already set off in the opposite direction so Ishmael wasted no time following. But, to his dismay, the Bot extended its arms and commenced a repair in the tunnel.
Cant you detour from your planned route? I need help! he found himself yelling.
My route is planned, the Bot replied.
And I guess the Civic offices will know your route?
Affirmative.
Great. So they will be waiting for us at the next intersection, even if we escape the one following. How far to the next intersection?
210 metres.
Hes gaining.
In his heightened sense of alertness, Ishmael found his hearing reaching out to detect any sound. His sense of smell and other senses heightened too, and with them, a sense of something else; a conversation in his head:
Are you sure you want Number Fourteen to return to base?
That is the orders from the Civic office. Just do it!
 I can detect the maintenance network! Ishmael said. Perhaps I can detect the soldiers. But try as he might, he could not. He stretched out his thoughts and reached for higher echelons of power. At the limit of his new capability, he detected a voice; the unmistakable one of Armande One, the President:
Is C199989 caught yet? Dont forget; Terminate on Sight! Do you hear? We cant risk any clone finding out about Project Infinity and attacking Supercity; that is why we built the Army in the first place.
Yes president.
***
The Bot turned a bend to the left in the tunnel and Ishmael realised he had to take drastic action. He scanned the tunnel for a weapon and picked up a length of discarded pipe. Letting the Bot travel ahead, he forced himself into the recess behind one of the shaft-props; the frames which supported the tunnel.
When the Bot had moved out of sight, Ishmael heard the steady, steely footfall of the soldier approach and then he saw the end of the laser barrel. He brought the heavy pipe down hard on the soldiers forearms and swung it up with all the force he could manage to smash the helmeted head upward and back. The soldier let go of the laser and smashed back against the far side of the tunnel before falling forward, onto his face. Ishmael stood over him and drove the pipe into the nape of the soldiers neck. Electric sparks arced across the damaged area and he withdrew the pipe to avoid a shock.
A Bot! he declared scathingly. Another voice inside his head reprimanded him for committing murder but he ignored it. He picked up the laser and surged after the Janitor Bot.
I killed him Fourteen! he exclaimed.
The Bot continued welding a broken joint.
Ishmael pointed the laser at a stanchion and pulled the trigger experimentally but nothing happened.
Damn! Its locked in some way. Stop Fourteen, we have to talk about this.  You are taking me to them, not away!
The Bot stopped obediently.
Which way is it to Clonecity?
I will arrive at your destination in less than twenty-four hours.
Yes, yes, I know. But which way is it. Point to it.
The Bot made a brief calculation and extended one of its arms to point to the right and behind them.
But we are going in the opposite direction! Listen, my life is in danger. You have to save my life. The First Law of Robotics states that; a robot may not injure a Citizen or, through inaction, allow a Citizen to come to harm.
That is incorrect. The First Law states; a robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
What? Human being is what the clones call themselves! Just how long ago were you programmed, you piece of junk!
I have just received instructions to report your location to my Operator.
You have harmed Citizens.
Yes, that is true.
The Bot seemed to consider this, before asking:
Why are you travelling to Clonecity?
I need their help. Wait Ishmael thought fast. I want to warm them!
I must help you.
Good. Take me by the most direct route to Clonecity.
The Bot immediately turned and rolled back down to where they had first entered the tunnel by the pipe. Instead of turning left, into the pipe, it turned right, into another maintenance tunnel, one which terminated in heavy metal doors.
Whats this? Ishmael asked.
Elevator 1342. It is damaged.
While the Bot analysed data from a diagnostics probe, inserted into a panel on the elevator wall, Ishmael hovered like an expectant father, asking all sorts of questions which slowed down the Bot.
Wait, the Bot said.
Its alright for you to say, youre not the one they are going to shoot when they get here!
The bot pressed a switch in the panel and the doors of the elevator slowly opened. Both stepped into the elevator but the Bot proceeded to remove the control panel cover in the lift, after which it inserted one of its arms into the cavity.
Theyre coming! I can hear them. Two.
The pounding of metal feet grew louder until Ishmael saw two soldiers turn the corner. He pointed the laser menacingly out of the elevator doors and the soldiers retreated, out of view. Moments later, they re-emerged, one falling to his knees, the other to a prone position, before firing. Ishmael threw himself back against the side of the elevator and heard the laser charges taking hot slices out of the back of the elevator. The Bot also got a taste of hot laser on one of its panels but pressed a button and the elevator doors slid closed. An instant later, they were travelling upwards at five feet per second. 
That was close. Are you damaged?
Affirmative.
Sorry.
The Bot began to replace the panel carefully.
Wait! Ishmael said.
***

When the elevator stopped, the Bot exited, into a wide tunnel, which headed north.
Ishmael stuck his hand into the open panel and ripped out some cables.
How long will it take to reach Clonecity now? Ishmael asked, catching up with the Bot.
One hundred and nineteen minutes. The soldiers are ahead of you. They know our location and direction.
Then I have to get this laser to fire. Can you hack it?
Insufficient data to respond.
Can you bypass the security code on this weapon?
Insufficient data to respond.
Fine. Lets try. Stop!
The Bot stopped obediently and Ishmael searched for a way to connect the two machines.
Your skin is damaged. Do you need assistance? the Bot asked.
Ishmael looked down at his hip and saw a great flap of skin hanging off. Below it, he could see ripped flesh and something that shone.
Strange; I didnt feel anything.
He poked his finger into the wound and touched something hard and metallic. Although he hadnt seen a damaged Citizen since an Ambulance ran over a minor when he himself had been a minor, he knew that there should be bone inside his hip and bone didnt feel metallic. He sought his memory for other incidents involving his anatomy; visits to the dentist, hospital and doctor. All of them were blanks, with any facts related to him later by his parents. It seemed as if he had somehow blacked-out during all the incidents. He couldnt remember ever seeing an X-ray image of bones or teeth. But when he cut himself, he bled.
I dont want to deal with this right now.
He returned his attention to the Bot and found a set of cables with sockets, neatly retracted. On the lasers butt, he found a matching socket and plugged in one of the cables.
Good thing, some things dont change! he exclaimed. He jammed the laser into a recess on the Bots top and said, Try and activate the laser while we keep moving.
The tunnel stretches as far as Ishmael could see so, while they moved along it, he watched the readout on the Bot; numbers flashed across the screen as the Bot tried combinations.
Ishmael again became aware of voices in his head and loudest of all, he recognised that of Armande One:
You have C199989 surrounded? Just a few minutes? Great. Have him brought to me if possible but shoot to Terminate if he, it, whatever it is, resists.
Security seems less secure, the higher up you go.
They passed a cross-tunnel and minutes later, Ishmael heard the familiar metallic sound of boots behind them.
Hurry Fourteen! How much longer?
The Bot continued to work in silence but then stopped. Ishmael could see a larger intersection ahead and then, into the opening, stepped three soldiers. They aimed their lasers directly at Ishmaels head.
The code, the Bot suddenly announced, is.
Just open it! Ishmael exclaimed. He looked down and a red light on the barrel of the laser turned green He reached down and wrenched the laser free.
Citizen C199989, do not move, the soldier with the red flash ordered.
Ishmael fired and hit the soldier squarely in the head.
Too late, he whispered and stepped neatly to the side of the tunnel, behind a shaft-prop, while the laser charge from the other soldier passed by him and over the Bot. The soldiers flash immediately turned red.
Squad close in! the soldier ordered.
Intimidation. He could use the network.
Fourteen, tell me the locations of the soldiers.
One; ahead. Four; behind. One; dysfunctional. Sixty two in transit to west-central six.
Damn it! Where is west-central six?
We will arrive there in approximately five minutes if we do not become dysfunctional.
You mean if you dont. Ishmael took a deep breath.
Now or never!
Lets go! he yelled before leaping out and charging towards the single, oncoming soldier.
While the soldier had the advantage of specialised programming, outstanding speed and agility and excellent marksmanship, it had the disadvantage that it had been designed to shoot and stun humans, not shoot and kill Citizens, who were made largely of carbon and metal compounds. Ishmael also had the advantage that his premature Termination had become almost inevitable so he had nothing to lose.
The two adversaries dodged behind the props and other obstructions in the decaying tunnel while closing at tremendous speed. Shot after shot missed Ishmael by millimetres while he could not seem to land many shots on the dancing soldier. Moreover, the soldiers armour changed colour to match its background, making the grunt appear almost transparent at times. When Ishmael did land a shot, it deflected like a drop of rain.
They had closed to just over ten metres when a shot from the soldier passed straight through Ishmaels upper laser arm, forcing him to the drop the weapon and dive to retrieve it. The grunt didnt anticipate this and, intending only to disable the Citizen, fired a long, careless burst at the sprawling figures legs. The shot missed and instead, sliced a long slit through a steel rail. Because of this long shot, and because Ishmael had not been able to get the soldier within his sights very often, the grunts laser ran down to zero charge first.
Rather than take the fraction of a second required to swap cartridges, the corporal opted to discharge its own power directly into the butt of the laser, giving him just one more shot.
Ishmael got lucky. He had spun after picking up the laser, purely acting on something most people would call instinct. He came out of the turn on his back, pointing his laser barrel at the neck of the grunt, who had begun to recharge his laser. This took half a second and in that time, Ishmael forced himself to focus and fire one, steady beam into the vulnerable neck of the grunt, just below his helmet.
The heat from the long shot bore into the grunts neck. He had been programmed not to suffer from pain but his sensors told him the intensity of the shot would almost certainly disable him. He growled, as he had been taught as a novice grunt to do when cornered by an enemy, and raised his recharged laser for a shot. But the barrel never lined up with its target. In an instant, some of the android soldiers major circuits burned through and he lost primary control of his laser arm. An instant later, his C-chip shorted and his useless body slumped across the rails. Somewhere behind Ishmael, another grunts flash turned red and he took command.
Come on! Ishmael yelled, pulling aside the grunts body to let Number Fourteen past. He sprinted to the intersection, checked to both sides and ran across to the continuation of their tunnel, opposite. I presume its this way? he yelled back.
Affirmative, Number Fourteen responded, trundling across the complex points in the rails at the intersection.
How far now to Clonecity?
Six hundred metres.
Good, and how far to the nearest soldiers?
Two hundred and fifty metres.
Ahead of us?
Affirmative.
Can you just say, Yes, instead of affirmative? It takes too long.
Yes.
I need charge, Ishmael announced. But theres no time. I will use reserve. How do I charge the laser?
Place the base of the butt in Socket 18, the bot replied.
Good. Now is there another way? I dont want to meet more soldiers.
Yes. Turn left in ten metres.
Some steps interrupted the alleyway after just twenty metres. The Bot used its set of three wheels around each axle-end to negotiate the steps and trundled on to a wall at the end.
Where now?
Up.
Ishmael looked at his limp arm and up at a long ladder, dubiously. But the Bot inserted a key into a tiny slot in a panel and an electrical whirring could be heard. Moments later, a Janitor Bot-sized platform descended on four cables and stopped in front of them. Number Fourteen rolled onto the platform and Ishmael clung to the side. The Bot withdrew the key and the platform rose at great speed.
As they rose, they passed outlets which blasted hot air into Ishmaels face. The platform stopped and the Bot rolled onto a bridge over a circular opening, about fifty metres across. Thin rubber strips, between the flanges on the Bots wheels, three around the end of each of its two axles, had expanded to form rubber tyres. Ishmael followed but the blast of hot air from below almost made him lose his balance. He had to crawl behind the Bot, on the narrow bridge.
On the other side, the Bot rolled into a narrow pipe and Ishmael had to grab hold of the grab rail and let himself be again dragged along.
I will have no skin left soon! he yelled, as parts of him were ripped off by sharp edges in the pipe.
Suddenly, there were huge gaps in the floor of the pipe and Ishmaels leg caught in the jagged biometal, or biomet of the broken pipe. He pulled it loose so that the Bot could continue and then saw, far below him, a mass of soldiers deploying. He tried to focus his mind and thought he could hear a lot of network chatter but couldnt pick anything out in particular. The Bot stopped.
We have to go down, it announced.
Ishmael stood and climbed aboard another platform, which took them down two levels. The Bot moved off, northward but stopped at an intersection soon after.
Clonecity is straight ahead. I can take you no closer because it is not safe for Janitors.
Alright. Straight ahead?
Ishmael picked up the laser and saw the green light. He walked over the intersecting tunnel and red alert lights began to flash in the tunnel in front of him.
Warning. Danger of clone attacks! blared from loudspeakers.
He turned to the Bot:
Hey. Thanks for the laser and thanks for the help, Number Fourteen. I hope they dont Terminate you. Good bye!
Good bye.
***
Way Out

Ishmael walked into the tunnel, now completely bathed in red light from the alerts. The speakers continued to warm him of clones as he reached an obstruction in the tunnel.
Yellow tape had been wrapped around rusty scaffolding, which stretched to the roof. A sign, painted in red, told him that; Only Military Access Permitted.
He bent under the tape and clambered through gaps in the scaffolding. He had to scramble for quite a distance before the scaffolding ended and he could walk on the tunnel floor again. The tunnel turned sharply to the right and converged with three more from the south. They merged to form one, long tunnel with steps. Ishmael began to climb. Several times, he heard steps echoing in the tunnel behind him and had to quicken his pace. After almost thirty minutes, the tunnel terminated in a hatch, set into a bulkhead. He shot off the simple lock and climbed through the hatch, into a round, sloping tunnel with smooth sides. Air roared past him and the tunnel seemed to narrow ahead but he had to keep moving.
Every ten or so metres, a security cam swung to follow Ishmaels progress. Soon the pipe became so steep that he had to crawl and then he saw a set of vanes at the end. He dragged himself to the circular frame around the vanes and peered between them. A few feet further on, he could make out a large fan, which turned so fast that, like an aircraft propeller, it allowed him to see right through to more scaffolding.
His spirit sunk.
This cant be the way! he yelled in frustration.
Hey you! Can you hear me! he heard from the scaffolding beyond. Ishmael activated his speech to reply:
Yes. I hear you! Are you a clone?
Can you stop the fan?
The voice sounded desperate so Ishmael looked for any kind of control. He found one, a lever, sticking out of a black box with the label; Emergency Stop.
Stop! announced a mechanical voice behind him. Citizen C199989, we know you are in there. Come out with your hands empty and no harm will come to you. We only want to talk to you.
Ishmael briefly wondered who lied, the soldier or the President, or perhaps neither, but he reached up, pulled down the lever and crawled through the vanes.
The razor sharp fan blades slowed until he could count them; five. There would be enough space to crawl between when they were stopped. He didnt want to risk his remaining skin by crawling too fast. With his nose a few centimetres from the blade path, he waited until they stopped. The tension almost made something inside his head snap. He found himself thinking in overdrive about what might happen to him in the next few seconds.
Its stopped. Shoot out the hub with your laser, the voice said.
Ishmael saw a young, dark-haired clone balanced on scaffolding.
Why? he replied.
Dont argue! No time. Just do it!
Ishmael, pointed the laser at the fans axle-housing and let go a short burst. Part of housing melted and drops of hot metal fell to the tunnel floor.
Now! shouted the voice though the blades. Jump now!
Ishmael got to his knees and dived through the blades, just as a laser beam sliced through the air above his head. He landed awkwardly because the pipe widened suddenly on the other side, creating as steep slope, down which he fell, on his back. He hung on to the laser and noticed that the fan blades had been badly chipped by something on the clone-side. He also saw a makeshift armoured construction, which covered the hub of the fan.
He slid to a halt and saw a face, upside down, peering down at him. He turned over and his hand touched something soft; the sleeve of a clone corpse. Beyond it, another lay, half-decayed. Their smell and appearance horrified Ishmael and he pulled away.
Move. Get up here! the face of a clone girl yelled.
Ishmael twisted round and leaped for the lower girder of the scaffolding.
I cant believe you made it! yelled the girl, after helping Ishmael behind the cover of a thick biomet sheet. The laserguns should have taken you out!
What guns?
Does the laser work?
Yes.
The girl grabbed it. Watch this. She poked her head round the side of the biomet sheet, which seemed to have been placed there as armoured protection, and aimed at the fan. She fired a burst of less than a second before quickly pulling her arm back. From two armoured cupolas, placed a few metres above the fan duct, a hail of white hot laser automatic fire rained down on the biomet sheet and girders of the scaffolding around them. It stopped after a few seconds, followed by more accurate fire from the first soldiers to poke their heads out of the fan duct.
Dont worry, said the girl. Its only designed to stun. Androids, or Citizens as you call them, dont like to hurt us. But youll be out for an hour!
But the bodies down there?
Yeah. Technically, they dont hurt us but some fall off when they get stunned. We better get out of here.
Ishmael followed, thinking:
I couldnt agree more!
***
After creeping some way back on a maze of duckboards within the scaffolding, each step of the way protected by assorted sheets of biomet, the girl handed Ishmael back his laser and stood up.
Were safe now. My name is Serendipity, Serendipity Frankis. But everyone calls me Chancy or Chance. You can call me Chance. Youre an android, arent you?
I am a Citizen.
Whatever. You need help, dont you?
Yes. I cant go back.
Cool. Its cool man but I am so in trouble with my pop.
Pop?
My dad. Hes the leader and he aint gonna like this!
Why are you speaking? I thought clones could telepath like we can.
Some of us still can but we have to make eye contact first, to share codes. But Supercity Intelligence can read the traffic so its not safe.
Oh.
We dont think they can read thoughts but who knows?
Ishmael noticed the scaffolding opening out and more light filtering in; a pale light unlike that in Supercity. Chance stopped at a railing and Ishmael caught up with her. He saw a view, which astonished him. They were somewhere near the top of a virtual city of scaffolding. Ahead of him lay a vast cavern, stretching perhaps twenty miles northwards, three wide and a mile high. Small, fenced off areas could be seen, which contained some livestock. A few dwellings were dotted about but it mostly looked desolate; no colour or vegetation. It looked nothing like the pictures and recordings of lush green forest and plush dwellings that Ishmaels clone recordings contained. The roof, consisting of huge, transparent panels, hung about three quarters of a mile above them. Through it, Ishmael could just make out a bright patch of light to the west in a red sky. He noted with satisfaction that the clones all had similar features to him, except for much smaller hands and feet; just as the history books portrayed.
***
Are we underground? Ishmael asked.
Sure. Just like Supercity, Chance replied.
No. That is on the surface. But this is Ishmael searched for the right word but couldnt find it. Disappointing, he added.
Yeah. You could call it that. Come on, I have to take you to my dad. Be nice to him. Otherwise you might be disassembled!
Chance led Ishmael down a long series of ladders. It quickly became clear to Ishmael that the scaffolding, as he had thought it, actually consisted of a conglomeration of building parts and that, for some reason, the clones must have taken apart their dwellings and used them to build the bizarre construction. As they descended, crowds of onlookers began go gawp or follow them.
Finally, proper flights of steps replaced the ladders and the two could walk at leisure down to ground level. Even so, Ishmaels reserves had almost failed by then.
I need charge. Do you have any charge bars or anything like that?
You mean; you need recharging?
Well, that sounds very mechanical when you put it like that!
You certainly are strange for an Android. I never met one but I have been told they are very emotionless. You seem anything but! I will ask my dad. Here he is.
Chance! a tall man, dressed in silver and with a tight mop of black hair, like his daughter, exclaimed. How many times have I told you not to go to the fan alone! Ishmael noted that the man had sideburns, rare because very few clones still had any body hair.
Vanity, thought Ishmael. I have heard of it.
But dad, you said time is running out, now the lights are on! And he jammed the fan!
You could have died! Did you say he jammed the fan? Are you sure?
Yes. Shot it out. They wont start it again for at least a few days!
Hm. Thats interesting. But the tall mans eyes were fixed on Ishmael. What have you brought me? Somebody take the laser. A man, heavily armoured himself, and carrying a crude weapon with the barrel, took away Ishmaels laser and handed it to the tall man.
Dad, this is. Oh, I didnt ask your name?
Ishmael, Ishmael replied.
Ishmael, Chance continued. This is my dad, Jonr. Dad, this is Ishmael!
An android! But a battered one and I am wondering why.
Dad. The droid needs power. Hes almost out.
Hm. That will be tricky. We havent had a visitor from the City for nearly a thousand years.
I remember it on the news, Ishmael exclaimed. The food delivery machinery failed and teams of Medics had to bring it in by hand. The clones Terminated one.
Yes. That is pretty much as our records show, Jonr replied. Then you must be a C-type?
I dont know what you mean, Ishmael replied. I am a Citizen.
Come on, lets find my chief mechanic. He might have something.
An oily-faced man with red hair and a livid scar on his cheek clambered out from underneath a broken generator, once Jonr had led Ishmael into a ramshackle workshop.
Kris, guess what we have?
I can see it but I dont believe it! Kris cried. ACitizen!
Yeah! And a friendly one too. Hes escaped.
Kriss eyes turned to the laser and his eyes bulged:
The very latest laser? he half-asked Ishmael.
Yes. I think so; Supercity Armys.
How the hell did you get that? Kris asked.
Hell? Oh, I see; religion. We dont have religion. I just killed him and took it.
Ha! Jonr chuckled. I like you already. Kris, theCitizen needs charging.
Okay. 4000 volts? I have an old adaptor somewhere.
Kris led Ishmael through a series of dimly lit streets, really just spaces between ramshackle lean-tos, until they came to another shed, built against the stone wall of Supercity itself. Kris turned a key in an old-fashioned padlock and opened the door. He pointed to a red outlet plug and said:
There you go.
Ithis is very crude. I dont want anybody to watch.
Okay, Jonr said. How long will it take?
Just ten minutes will do.
Well wait outside.
The door closed and Ishmael placed his mouth gingerly over the red socket adaptor. Instantly, he felt the hot surge of 4000 volts. The charge made him feel good but he also felt ashamed at his position. He hoped nobody would open the door. After ten minutes, he re-emerged.
What did Chance mean, Ishmael began, when he said; Time is running out, now the lights are on? I have been thinking about it.
You will find out soon enough, Jonr replied. But right now, we have to act fast. If the fan is jammed, as Chance tells me, we may only have a few hours. I will call together all the leaders as soon as possible. Ishmael, stay with Chance and dont go far. I will need you. Do you mind if I keep the laser for now?
No. I dont like weapons.
Hm. There really is something different about you; more like a human than an Andro-I mean, Citizen.
Humans are a mythical race from Earth. They never existed! Ishmael declared.
The others laughed.
You will find out the truth of that too, soon, Jonr added. Once we take you to the Tri-mex building.
***
Why do you call us clones? Chance asked, as soon as they were away from the adults. We are real humans and we built the robots!
But that is nonsense. Its just something that your forefathers wrote down in a book; the Third Testament. It isnot really true. Although, I do value religion. Clones need it for survival and they best understand the flora and fauna of Earth. We believe in Conservation!
Oh yeah? Look how we live? Its an existence but no chance to evolve. Thats not Conservation!
Where are your crops and livestock?
That was on Earth, millions of years go. Earth is a long way from here!
You mean Earthone. Yes, it is a long way. But our books show you with crops and livestock, vegetation; trees.
No trees here and very little vegetation. Somebody lied to you!
Nobody in Supercity lies. Citizens cannot lie.
Or kill. But you killed.
Yes. AndI lied. I am not so sure about anything anymore.
Why were you running and why did they want to kill you?
Initially, I broke the law but then I lied and killed. I will be terminated if I go back.
Not if you go back with us. Which law did you break?
I ran.
Yes. I know, but which actual Law?
It is illegal for an adult to run in Supercity.
Wow! That is purple! Anybody can run here!
Purple?
Yeah; extreme, weirdor really good.
Oh. You are a very interesting clone Chance. I have been told clones hate Citizens now.
No. We dont hate androids. They keep us alive, but they dont understand us. Look, there is the Tri-mex building. That is where they used to build all the androids; probably even you!
Ishmael stopped to look at a large rotunda that rose at least a thousand feet into the caverns lofty air. It looked like it had been chiselled out of solid obsidian; its smooth black surfaces and windows reflected almost no light.
Why didnt I see it from the scaffolding? Ishmael asked.
Scaffold City? Ha! cause it has that fancy camouflage; cant be seen from above. Thats the way they built things when wars were still possible. It was still used for research for a while after they stopped production.
Well they didnt build me. I can assure you that Citizens have been around a lot longer than clones; some say we were here before the Big Bang and came from Universe B.
Ha! I have heard that idea. But, first of all, nobody knows if its possible to survive the Big Crunch, and secondly, humans createdCitizens, if you want to call yourselves that, not the other way round. There are no traces of Citizens before the first humans, four or five million years ago. In fact, there are no traces of Citizens before about the first millennium AD.
You are quite correct in the first case. Even though the Android  I hate that term  Human Alliance, the AHA, eventually proved the Penrose model of two alternately expanding and contracting universes correct in 0.1B, it is mere speculation to suggest that any species could survive the collapse of either Universe A or B. Such survival would depend on the postulated existence of the Iris Star of Blinker, as some call it.
But you are quite wrong about the existence of Citizens before cl-humans. I have seen the evidence. Recently, archaeologist on Earthone found the oldest hominid, Arnie. He existed 5.4 million years BC. Only a few days ago, a news bulletin announced that they had isolated some DNA from Arnie and that it contained tensi. These tensi are basically the Makers Stamp; repeated molecule strings which hand off DNA strands and form the letters MC, which we know mean Made by Citizens.
Well, I admit I know nothing about chemistry but my dad told me there is no proof that MC stands for Made by Citizens. Where is your proof?
They dont exist anymore because they are not required but they first appear with the first hominids! They had no other use. What else could they be for?
That is no proof. Even you should know that! And ifCitizens did exist before humans, where are their remains?
As I am sure you know, since you are so well-informed, we Citizens have made ourselves biodegradable, in the name of Conservation, which is our highest calling.
Ishmael and Chance had passed the steps to the Tri-mex building, which Ishmael barely glanced at, and now Chance stopped at a low building inside a roughly constructed fence.
What is this? Ishmael asked.
I wanted to show you something, Chance replied.
I would like to learn anything about your culture.
Chance pushed open a gate and led Ishmael round to the back of the low building. Three cows grazed in a tiny meadow of scrawny grass.
Ishmael stared for a moment and asked:
Cows! Real cows! I have never see one. I have seen tigers and camels in my minority. Can I touch one?
Sure. They are docile.
As if they had heard, the cows trotted up to the two visitors and muzzled Chances hand for something tasty to eat. They were wary of Ishmael but Chance grabbed a clump of grass and stuck it into Ishmaels good hand:
Hold it out. They will eat it.
When the cow had taken all the grass, Ishmael patted the curly hairs on the top of its head and said;
Well, I am glad to see you still have farms and are cultivating.
They are the last we have. We have tried to breed more and grow crops but we were left with little more than dust. Nothing much grows here.
What do you use as fertilizer?
Ill show you.
Chance led Ishmael back to the shed opened the door and said:
Wont go in myself. My dad forbids it and anyway, I dont want to look. But I know what is in there.
Ishmael walked into a large, tiled workshop. In one corner, lay a large heap of dry soil. In another, lay a pile of grey ash. In the centre, stood a row of three ovens. But his eyes were drawn to a long, slick stone table. Upon it lay human remains; parts of human torsos, limbs teeth and bones. Ishmael turned and walked out of the room. The look of horror and confusion on his face forced and explanation from Chance:
The dust we manage to scrape up is mixed with ash from burned corpses. Some of the flesh is left to decompose under the soil as fertilizer; we still have flies and worms. Its purely voluntary for us to do this when we die, but, in reality, everyone volunteers. You see, there are only a million of us here.
Yes I know. That was the figure set by the Alliance. It has to remain constant. But Ishmaels mouth worked on automatic. His mind still struggled to cope with the disparity between what he had seen and what he had read in books about clones.
Its a sort of conservation, I suppose, Chance quipped.
Ishmael shook his head.
***
We have to be heading back, Chance told Ishmael at the farm gate. He will have to hold this briefing pretty soon if we are going to attack. And we need to fix your arm so you can help us.
Attack? What attack?
Attack Supercity. Now we can get in through the fan!
But why didnt a clone jam the fan mechanism?
We have been trying for many years. At first, they closed down most of the fans. Only two remain; one near the roof and the one your came through. We cant reach the one near the roof. Well, one crazy guy created a flying machine and nearly made it, but thats another story. Anyway, the fan was high on Supercity wall so, to reach it, we had to build a scaffold. The only material we had was our own buildings. It took most of them to reach the half mile up the wall. Many attempted to get through the fan. At first, specially programmed Police Supers defended it from your side and those that reached the fan were captured or fell to their deaths. Now they have installed much faster laser guns. Anyway, to answer your question, we got as close as you saw me but they have an armoured hub over the mechanism. Our lasers simply cant cut through it. Thats why I told you to shoot it out while you were in the duct.
Ah, the attack; it explains a lot. I think they have been expecting it for some time. That is why they build the Supercity Army.
They know? We have to tell my dad. This is not good.
Chance quickened her pace but before they reached Scaffold City, had to risk one more question. She could see now how clever her father had been in leaving her alone with the android. The machine seemed to like her and had told her a lot in a short space of time. Perhaps it could tell her more:
How did you manage to kill the soldier?
Which one?
The one you got the laser from?
I found that a metal bar, thrust through the back of the neck, seemed to work quite well.
I see. Thats something else we need to tell my dad. Since they will only stun us at worst, we can creep up on them and poleaxe them!
I do not think so. They are designed to Terminate on Sight; I heard the President say so.
But thats not possible. No Andr-I mean Citizen, has ever killed a clone intentionally.
***
Night had fallen when Jonr opened the briefing. A large hall had been filled to capacity with 10,000 men and women, mostly dressed in camouflage fatigues. Ishmael and Chance sat to one side of the stage, with a line of twenty leaders.
Earlier, while Kris repaired Ishmaels arm, Chance told her dad what Ishmael had said about Supercitys Army.
They know about the attack? Jonr exclaimed. Its impossible. Nobody that telepaths knows of it! 
Makes sense, Kris muttered. They know we are desperate because of the Hangar lights. They know, and we know, that time is running out.
And RBs, added Ishmael, not really knowing what they were talking about.
RBs? Jonr repeated.
Reality Breakdowns are increasing, Ishmael explained.
Right. But if they know about the attack, they either have somebody on the inside or they have some kind of listening device.
No way, they have somebody on the inside, Kris protested.
Yeah. Unlikely. Anyway, it would take too long to find out. We have to assume they have something. That means we cant meet in the Great Hall unless.
Immediately, a detailed search began, to find any kind of listening device the Supercity might have planted in Scaffold City. Efforts were concentrated near the Great Hall and Johrs living quarters. After they had completely ripped that apart and found nothing, they widened the search to dwellings around it. They found wires, which led to a black sensor under the eaves of a neighbouring room. They found nothing in the hall.
There still might be something here, Kris suggested, sitting among a pile of ripped up floorboards in the hall.
Put them back. Well have to risk it. All the secret stuff is normally discussed at my place and I need everyone together for this. There can be no chain-of-command cock-ups. Anyway, theres no time.
Now, Jonr stood at the front of the stage and announced that they would attack the following day.
A roar went up, which the leader had some difficulty quelling so that he could continue:
This time, we have an ally. Our friend here, he said, indicating Ishmael, is a fugitive from Supercity and he has damaged the fan from inside so it will take Supercity engineers a few days to repair it. This gives us the window of opportunity we have been looking for and will forever be in his debt. We have to succeed first time. He has actually terminated a soldier. He did it using a metal rod, pushing through the back of the neck so all your lasers will have a heavy, sharpened rod welded on. Use it!
Our friend has also told us that we will have to fight our way through miles of tunnels and that there is no longer any form of vegetation in Supercity so your camouflage will be useless. Everybody must dye their suits black and paint white stripes on them in a random pattern like this! He held up a suit that Kris had prepared before the briefing. Our friend, who is called Ishmael by the way, also has the very latest laser and we have picked up a few tricks from it. However, there is not time to upgrade you all; one in ten of you will receive the upgrades.
Now, it seems that although they had instructions to Terminate Ishmael on sight, the soldier bots were reluctant to do it. Now, you may say, Well, this fits in with their Laws of Conservation, and that they will only stun us but Im not so sure. I have talked with Ishmael at length about this and we are both agreed that the soldiers will have been designed to kill humans  although they call us clones  based on the principle that our invasion of Supercity represents a threat to the stability of the whole colony here on Marstoo. In other words, these soldiers have been designed for one purpose and that is to kill human rebels. So be very careful.
Jonrs understated warning brought a ripple of chuckles from the huge audience.
Now, you may have wondered how we know that the soldiers were ordered to kill Ishmael. It seems that our friend here can pick up network traffic, which, of course, at soldier level is totally secure. But it seems it is not, at the highest level; within the Presidents office. This is our edge. So I want you to stick to all commands that come down the chain and then we will succeed.
It only remains for me to point out the obvious; many of you will die but when, not if, we succeed, once again humans will have control of their own destiny on Marstoo and that surely has to be worth fighting, and dying, for!
A roar of approval went up from the audience, which Jonr allowed to die down naturally. He grinned and concluded:
We are the Rebel Army and we are going to win! His audience erupted again but this time he hushed them with his arms spread wide. All squad commanders stay behind. The rest of you; dismissed and good luck!
***
After Jonr had briefed his commanders, he took Ishmael and Chance under his arms and led them to his dwelling for a feast. His partner, Mira, a hazel-eyed beauty with matching hair, helped him stashed away the best food for such an occasion and. Ishmael could only dispose of the the liquid part of the meal, through a narrow tube in his mouth, a courtesy device from the days when Citizens cohabited with humans. However, he enjoyed the friendly conversation and the warmth the family extended to him. The meal reminded of those he had spent with his parents so long ago. Mira often stole glances at him and at the end of the meal, mentioned how like a human Ishmael seemed. For some reason he could not explain to himself, he felt complimented.
Do you havefamily in Supercity? she asked.
Not really. My parents were naturally terminated a long time ago. Their M-tags will still existsomewhereI have a girlfriend but we are not married and have no children. I dont know why that must be. He cast his eyes down sadly.
Neither Jonr nor Mira knew what an M-tag was, nor why he seemed so sad but they asked no further questions.
Will you be involved in the attack? Ishmael asked Mira.
Yes. Of course. Only the old and children will stay behind. It must succeed!
He smiled at her determination.
Now, I have two things I have to show you Ishmael. Are you ready?
Yes.
Jonr led his guest and daughter down to the ground level and began the long trek to the east wall.
We dont have vehicles here. We walk everywhere. I hope you dont mind the exercise.
No. I am fully charged.
Jonr seemed suddenly lost in thought.
Eventually, they reached a metal and glass structure, at the base of the cavern wall. Beside it, a metallic stairway zigzagged to the top of the wall, a mile above. On the other side, three queues of clones lined up outside other elevators marked Public.
Jonr led them inside and into a large metal cage.
An elevator, Ishmael suggested.
Yes. We dont use it very often but only this one goes almost to the top and, as leader, its one of my privileges  when time is short. Jonr winked at Ishmael, who immediately understood the joke and felt a pleasant surge of emotion.
I like this man.
The other elevators stopped about two thirds of the way to a platform, near the top of the cavern. Outside the elevator, Ishmael could see many people, either ascending wearily, or descending the stairway. It wasnt long before the elevator halted but not at the top of the stairs.
We must climb the rest of the way, Jonr explained. The structure above is no longer safe.
At last, Ishmael reached the platform at the stop of the steps, slightly behind Jonr and Chance.
Look Ishmael. Isnt it pretty? Chance exclaimed. She nodded towards the vast, panoramic windows in front of him. Ishmael had already seen the circle of a myriad bright lights in the distance. From time to time, one would wink out, as something passed in front of it, followed by the wink of its neighbour. The huge structure, outside the protective covering of the cavern seemed to be a few miles away and about half a mile in diameter.
What is it? Ishmael asked.
A spaceship, Jonr replied. Built to survive the Big Crunch. Isnt she a beauty?
But why havent I heard of it? A ship that size should be all over the news!
Top Secret; thats why! Jonr replied. And we helped build it! It is designed for a crew of androids and humans but the androids, or Citizens, as you call them, have taken over the whole project and locked us out! It will leave in the next few months. That is why we have been increasing our attempts to get inside Supercity.
I think perhaps I understand something! Ishmael exclaimed. The Army has been set up to protect a Project Infinity. This could be it!
Yes! Probably.
But where is Supercity? Ishmael asked. I should be able to see it from here. It is above ground.
Jonr pointed to the south. See those flat panels there, stretching away into the distance? Thats the roof of Supercity.
No. It cant be! It is above ground! I look at the sky every night. Sometimes I see liners, on their way to Earthtoo. I even went there once!
Sorry Ishmael. Supercity is below ground, just like Clonecity. The new arrivals on this planet, found only one likely place to build a colony; inside a great north-south canyon. That is what it is. The planet has enough starlight for life but its surface is inhospitable and has no life-forms. The temperature out there reaches 100 degrees centigrade  below zero. Its the same above zero during the daytime. We used to maintain the vast fields of starlight generators out there that provide energy for the cities. But we are not permitted anymore. Its done by bots now. Jonr could see the look of disbelief on Ishmaels face. Sorry. Somebody has lied to you.
But Citizens cannot.
Lie? Chance finished. You told me you lied to the Policeman.
Yes. Something is very wrong here. I no longer know what is real and what I am! Ishmael concluded.
Welcome to the world! declared Jonr. Reality is not a single entity. There are many layers of reality, the most solid of which is the one shared by most. For instance, we all live in a Universe; Universe A. That is a single reality and we all share it. It is the foundation of our culture. It may change one day but for now, it is our foundation. Other realities may be personal, fleeting, or exist only between two lovers. I want to show you something else. Come with me.
As Jonr led them back to the stairs, he pointed out a welded-up set of doors in the wall:
We used to have our own corridor to the spaceship. The Androids cut us out and removed the corridor. You can see where it used to run. We could unseal the door but we dont have the technology or materials to build spacesuits anymore.
***
Jonr led Ishmael and Chance back to the steps of the Tri-mex building, where he sent Chance off to bed.
She needs to get a good nights sleep, Jonr explained. She will be in the attack tomorrow. Fourteen is old enough, in my books. Do you sleep Ishmael?
Yes. We need to sleep, to regenerate our thought patterns,
But does your performance deteriorate if you miss a nights sleep? Jonr asked, leading Ishmael up the steps of the obsidian building.
No.
Ours does.
Jonr took out a set of large keys and proceeded to unlock a set of padlocks.
The mind-imprint locks no longer work, he explained.
When all the chains were removed from the door handles, Jonr swung the great doors open and led his guest into a vast concourse.
Up these steps, Jonr said, switching on the lights.
Does anybody else come here?
Nope. Only me and Kris, occasionally.
At the top of the third flight of steps, Jonr led Ishmael into a row of offices and down to one at the end. On a dais, rested a black plate. Jonr concentrated and the screen switched on.
We could do this telepathically but Im not keen on the security implications right now. I guess you probably have something better in Supercity. What was your job?
Journalist.
Here we go. This is the central archive of Tri-mex. Tri-mex started out as Trion, over two billion years ago, when Capitalism still ruled economies. It became big enough to control whole continents and people were born into the company, much like earlier nationalities. But, as you know, the three Great Wars each destroyed whole colonies including Earth itself. God knows how far we would have developed if it hadt been for these Wars, the Billion Year War being the worst. Did you know the oldest human lived to be 923 years old? The average age around the last billenium was 390! Now, we are lucky if we see 200! Dont talk to me about Conservation! Anyway, long before that, Capitalism failed and Trion had to diversify. They added two arms; robotics and spaceships and this is the very last facility of theirs that I know of. Read this.
Ishmael stepped onto the dais and scanned the page in a fraction of a second. He used the cursor to turn pages and finished the company report within a few seconds. He regurgitated the main points;
So Tri-mex claim to have maintained a generation of super-androids, which they called the C-class. They claim that they are distinguished by a Makers Tag, or Mtag, which is not biodegradable. They also claim that the C-class androids are indistinguishable from humans, except for the means of recharging, through a socket in the mouth. The C-class can have sex, procreate and go through various stages of youth until adulthood. That matches my life precisely! Too bad it is mere fantasy!
Is it? Tri-mex records that the first C-class had been identified in the Third Milennum but its origin never established. Tri-mex believed that the C-class have existed since the mid 20th Century but no proof could be found. Only 200,000 existed and vanished from sight in 1944, only to reappear 100 years later, at the start of the Great Wars. They had a bizarre cover story to explain this. What do you think the explanation might be?
I know all about the C-class, and the explanation. They cloned hominids to createyou! They existed millions of years before clones and may have come from Universe B. I explained all this to Chance. We even have proof in the form of tensi; tiny Makers Stamps within the DNA helix.
Thats rubbish. Tensi have been proven to be vestigial; many species have them and its basically DNA trash that has disappeared over the centuries.
Ishmael paused for a moment, surprized at Jonrs vehemence, before continuing:
The C-class vanished because they wanted humans to develop robots on their own. They explained their reappearance by fabricating a story that a Military Defence network went conscious, and began to build the C-class androids as drones to defend it.
I believe you are a C-class android. Only they tell this story.
I am a C-class Citizen. There are only 200,000 of us.  That much is true. But the rest of your story is a fabrication. Only clones can lie.
Chance said you admitted you could lie.
Ishmael did not respond.
Let me show you something else, Jonr suggested. He found another page and Ishmael began digesting the information.
Ishmael read the summary report of Project Protect. The project would be the last that Tri-mex would be assigned, and basically amounted to the design of twenty special Control-chips, or C-chips, which could traverse the increasing number of Reality Breaks expected near the beginning of the Big Crunch, the collapse of the Universe. The C-chips had to be designed to be fitted to C-class androids only and the class were not to be aware of the process. As a result, Tri-mex believed that the C-class androids might be the first in history to attain consciousness, but the Companys R&D department could not be sure of this. Ishmael read how Supercity stopped any communication with Tri-mex as soon as the delivery of the twenty chips had been made. That day occurred almost 1000 years before; when Ishmael was still a minor. Ismael looked up from the report and turned to Jonr.
Well? the leader asked.
Its certainly interesting.
I had forgotten about RBs until you mentioned them. Thats why I looked up this report. Their incidence is increasing; you said so yourself. It makes sense that Project Infinity would deploy these chips now, if it were ever to do so. I think you have one inside you. Do you know how these special chips work?
No.
I do. Humans experience RBs too, but for us, the effect is only a mild form of anger, believed to be caused by the new personality having the memories of the old one but not the experience. Yes, humans effectively reboot too. This build-up of layer upon layer of personalities is believed to be what makes us conscious; hence Tri-mexs belief that the C-class might become conscious.
The experimental C-chip contains ten circuits. Remember that the actual personality of the android is held in the P-chip, elsewhere; the C-chip just holds the basic parameters of personality; whether it should be married or single and have children or not.
Of the ten circuits, one is designated the Alpha circuit and is the current Control circuit. Another circuit is designated the Beta channel and yet another, the Gamma circuit. All the Beta channel does is poll the Alpha circuit every .01 seconds to ask; are you conscious? When it doesnt receive a response, it knows the Alpha circuit has shorted and it promotes itself to Alpha. The Gamma channel polls the Beta circuit every ten seconds  its polls are never at the same time as the Betas  and acts as a backup; RBs actually last for much less than .01 seconds so the chance of both Alpha and Beta being affected is tiny and that of Beta and Gamma, infinitesimally small. This process goes on until the tenth circuit becomes the Gamma circuit, at which point, an alert is sent that the chip needs replacing.
On a trip to the centre of the Universe, there are expected to be a decreasing number of RBs so ten circuits should be enough. Four were designed small enough to fit into minors, which will be needed to repopulate Universe B. Would any of that explain anything?
Well, yes! I have felt strange since an RB, the other day. I felt irritated at first, but then I felt more awake.
Well, we must go back.
***
On the way back to Scaffold City, Ishmael tried gently to turn the argument about evolution in his favour once more:
If it wasnt for our supreme concern for Conservation, clones would have destroyed themselves and you wouldnt be here, Jonr.
How much of human and android history do you know Ishmael?
You mean; Citizen.
No. I mean android. I am not going to spare you the truth. There is no time left; not for us and not even for the God of this Universe!
Ishmael stared at Jonr, trying to process the complex signals he had received.
No, I mean the real history, not some garbage you androids have convinved yourself is the truth.
Until the Third Milennum, the C-class androids hadnt really assimilated themselves into our culture enough to claim primacy so I will start from there. During that century, Ischians made Earth uninhabitable for 120 years but gradually life came back. Thankfully, a full range of plant/animal DNA had been stored under a mountain in Norway and in many cases for plants, seeds too, so that it didnt take long for man to repopulate earth.
However, the Ischians were always aggressive and when the first Stage Three culture, the Timpoids, made moves to harness the Ischian suns for power, the Ischians chose to retaliate with aggression, bringing about their own demise.
Humans chose rather to try and understand the universe than to simply harness its power. Much of our energy was expended in the years 3000-100,000 AD trying to work out the nature of the universe. This they did with the help of robots, later androids, but the price would be Earth itself, mined almost to the core for minerals, and man moved to Mars. Earth became just a hot, hollowed out hulk, with only a few tiny nature reserves maintained out of necessity.
Eventually, Mars too had to be abandoned at 1.6 billion years due to the Suns expansion and both Androids and humans in the Android-Human Alliance moved to Marstoo, terraforming a nearby planet to seem like Earth.
Meanwhile, man had harnessed communication without speech using electromagnetic implants, later genetically engineered bio-mechanisms, to generate radio signals. The colonies required less of men physically so their hands and feet could shrink to conserve heat loss on the new, cooler planet. Androids did all the work but had always created a big demand for power.
There had been many wars, notably the Billion Year war, starting in 1B0M090,992 when man had most fully developed his culture and competed for precious resources with the last of the Timpoids, allied with those more aggressive humans left on Marsone, who hadnt wanted to leave for a cooler star. The resulting war depleted reserves further but saw the end of the Timpoids and effectively Marsone.
As a result of the demands for power and loss of resources from the great wars, in one of their last acts as controllers of EVOTECH, in 2B1M278,555,  the organisation which had replaced governments in ordering our society, men made the androids highest goal that of Conservation rather than Exploration, Computation or Production. When the Alliance broke and androids took over, for the first time calling themselves Citizens, they began to model themselves on man in a misguided attempt to mimic life, believing the creation of an artificial copy of life to be the same as preservation.
In the last great AHA programme in the year 2B2M222,431, androids and man finally understood how they might survive the Big Crunch. For the first time, the idea of a Stage Four culture emerged, one that had essentially bypassed Stage Three in favour of understanding or intellectual development. They built a starship which might survive the Big Crunch.
One day, I will tell you about the cracking of time travel and how it caused mans final slide into apathy and servility. But my main point is that we programmed androids to put Conservation first.
Ishmael thought carefully before answering:
Well, I agree with all of that, it is all as we have recorded, except that man had to be rescued. That is all I will say!
Ishmael, you are stubborn! You dont know when you are beaten but I like you! I need to grab a few hours sleep. I dont know how much you want but I hope you will come with me tomorrow. We need you. I suggest you spend some time, probing the Presidents office network to see how you came to have the chip.
But it would be very dangerous for me to go back to Supercity!
What are you going to do here if we all die? You could lead the children and old-timers in one last desperate attack or live out your days here. Jonr indicated the vast wasteland inside the cavern with a sweep of his arm. Or you could find out the truth.
***
Battle

Ishmael didnt try to sleep. He had been given the room of a warrior, recently killed at the fan duct, and sat in a chair, trying to work his way into the Presidents private network. He had no luck and found himself walking round the room, looking at the dead mans possessions; holograms of girlfriends, award certificates, a few paintings, and a single locket, hanging on a platinum chain. Without considering his actions, Ishmael began to open the locket but stopped himself.
No, could be the most personal possession of this man. Let his secrets go with him.
But Ishmael found himself teasing the platinum chain through his fingers as he continued to think. It calmed him.
He remember what he had been trying to do and cast his thoughts back to the President. Suddenly, he heard a voice:
Its me, Armande. I cant sleep and my wife is driving me mad. Is there any news?
No sir. It seems oursurveillance team has lost communication too. Do you want me to escalate this to Emergency and deploy all agents, as we discussed?
No. We wait. I have the preliminary report on how this whole cock-up occurred. Mind you, I find the explanation more disturbing than any conspiracy! I will paraphrase the report. The Medical Bot assigned to replace C199989s C-chip during an RB had also passed through another RB, close to C199989s incident, a few minutes before; an event so unlikely as to have never happened before, causing it to malfunction. Medical Bots are always stationed in the Government buildings, a spot which very rarely experiences RBs and all Medical Bots have their chips replaced before going to an incident. Furthermore, by some event of incalculably remote probability, the Medical Bot had been assigned to collect one of the twenty special new chips for Project Infinity when it had been re-routed.
I see. Truly bizarre andunlucky, for us sir!
Yes, but not a conspiracy! That, at least, is something. We have to focus on stopping any clone attack. If this Ishmael leads them, it could be very difficult for us. How soon can you deploy the new Type 45s?
We are working on it. They are still officially prototypes; three of them. We can have most of glitches ironed-out in the next two hours sir. Another hour to deploy.
Good. There is something else. I am going to be on the move during this campaign so this will be my only channel of communication with you. Tighten up security will you. I know I have been too relaxed about it in the past.
Good thinking sir.
Frank. I know you have always been good at your job. Its me who let the ball slip. Dont let me drop it!
I understand sir. A good metaphor!
I got it out of a book.
Ishmael had to sit down.
So its true. I have had my chip replaced, by accident. And now I have become conscious. But clones seem to have always been conscious! The awful implications of this were too much for Ishmael to assimilate so he focused on something simple:
I have to warn Jonr. They have to attack within three hours.
He strode out of the room and headed to Jonrs dwelling, thinking while he walked:
What else can I find while I can still access the network? Size of the Supercity Army? Yes, that would be useful.
Ishmaels memory had stored the network location for the Presidents communication device so he used the same I.D. and probed for any database. He found one; Basic Utilities. He quickly discarded this and searched for others; Dinner Guests, Calendar Dates. He settled for Security and queried the database, storing all the data. Locating a reference to SA, he followed it though a mind-boggling number of abstract references until he alighted on a single data instance; 40,000.
Two sentries stopped Ishmael at Jonrs door.
He asked not to be disturbed, one of them protested.
I have information critical to the success of the Operation! Ishmael declared, starting to adopt the language of covert activities.
The sentry passed this message on and Jonr emerged, looking bedraggled, minutes later
What is it Ishmael?
 40,000? Youre sure? Jonr exclaimed, after hearing what Ishmael had discovered.
No. It is probably the correct figure.
Well, it sounds feasible and its all we have. We have 140,000 which is too few. Many of those the right age are malnourished or have other sicknesses; healthcare is non-existent here. It will have to do. But why the hell didnt you get more! You have the only way in to their network and all you come up with is the size of their Army! What are these Type 45? Where will they be? Where will Armande be? Where will this Frank be?
I am sorry. I am not a security expert or hacker. In fact, computer sciences are not one of my skills. However, I can answer the last two questions; every communication must be contained within a carrier signal and we can scan these for the ID of the caller until we find the Presidents and Franks and then track all data on that carrier signal.
Sorry. I am tense. Its not your fault. But while you can still get in, can you find out more? Keep scanning it as long as you can. Perhaps they will let something slip. I have to get the commanders ready. We go in two hours.
One would be better, Mira suggested.
Yes, she is correct, Ishmael added.
We cant! Not possible! Jonr protested.
Its possible, Mira told him.
Right. He kissed her and called the sentries.
***
Jonr lined up at the front of his own squad of eight men on the scaffold.  A few hundred metres in front, reached through the maze of duckboards and biomet sheets, lay the fan duct. To save time, only those first into the tunnel had been gathered. Their lasers looked crude, compared with Ishmaels and some of them had not had time to paint their fatigue black and white so had instead put on contrasting black or white trousers and shirts.
Ishmael stood next to Jonr and looked at the mens faces. They grinned and joked but the android felt confused by their expressions. The grins, which indicated humour, hid another emotion, perhaps fear.
Clone, no, human, emotions have always confused me!
He had begun to accept that his personality had been built on a chassis of steel and synthetic compounds; this didnt seem as bad as he had expected. So now he could allow himself to consciously access his own data banks instead of pretending he remembered. His memory banks told him that the correct term for the human expression was a grimace.
Right men, Jonr whispered. You all have a copy of the map Ishmael drew, so you know where to meet up if you make it that far. The second intersection. You all know the route so stick to it. They have 40,000, we have 140,000, but they have better equipment than us and communications! Two critical things have to happen if we are to get enough of our people in to win; taking out those two guns and fortifying the approach. If any of you drop your sheet, you will have to go back for a second. Is that understood?
Yessir!
I am taking ten men to take out the guns and Ishmael will lead five more to secure the first intersection. Remember: its okay to use telepathic links up to 50 metres but only when you need to, only use your team name and only use location codenames. And keep your signal strength to the absolute minimum. There will be a lot of static and reflections but that will confuse them. Beyond that, one runner has been assigned to each squad and we hope the soldiers will be less inclined to shoot an unarmed child. We regroup at the second intersection in precisely.
Ishmael glanced at Chance, who smiled back at him, and understood just how desperate this attack would be. At last he understood the horror of subjugation that the androids in Supercity had wrought and felt glad to be at the spearhead of the attack.
one hour, whispered Jonr. Go!
Jonrs hobnailed boot clattered along the duckboards as he carried his thick sheet of biomet to the jumping-off point. The Supercity guns opened fire an instant after he leaped into space but he kept the sheet in front of him and landed with a crunch on the sloping exit of the duct.
Ishmael landed behind him, carrying two sheets and both held these in front of them while the third man, Kris, bore three large holes, simultaneously, in the hard surface beneath them with a specially designed drill. The fourth man landed holding a small pylon fashioned beforehand, which he placed over the drilled holes before getting stunned and slumping over. The fifth man used a mechanical jack to bolt the pylon to the ground and the sheets slotted into holders on the pylon. The first barrier had been placed and all five men clambered up the slope, towards the duct, out of the guns field of fire. A single shot from one of the guns caught Jonrs foot, making him scream, but Ishmael moved ahead and dragged him up the rest of the slope and safely into the duct. One of the men who followed got hit in mid-air and fell forty feet to the scaffolding below.
Can you walk? Kris asked, coming up behind.
No. But I can limp. Lets go. You two, drag Jownes. Can you hear anything on the network Ish?
I can hear a beep from above; probably an alert on the guns. Thats all. I still dont know how to get to them.
Dont worry. Well find the way.
Jonr stopped and waited for his son to make it to safety. He clutched the grinning Chance briefly and they ran down the half-mile, sloping tunnel.
***
After negotiating the scaffolding, they continued down the slope to the first intersection. Again the alarms blared and bathed the tunnels in red light. It seemed to hurt the humans eyes so Ishmael led them into the transverse, and larger tunnel.
Kris, to the second intersection! ordered Jonr. Hold it until youre relieved.
Kris took four men and crossed into the tunnel opposite, quickly vanishing into the shadows.
Now we just have to find this entrance.
 It will be up a few levels, Ishmael suggested. He had walked further down the larger tunnel and suddenly came across a recess, containing a ladder.
Here! he shouted.
The others came running.
Whats down there? Jonr asked, pointing at a cover at the base of the ladder.
I can check, Chance offered.
No Chance. We need you here. Check later. Up we go. We have to leave Jownes here.
Let me go first, Ishmael suggested. They are less likely to shoot me.
His last two words were cut off by the screaming of the laser guns as the second team came in. Before they had reached an aperture, thirty feet up the ladder, half of the second squad arrived at the intersection and turned to the right in a predesignated move, to take and hold the next intersection.
Ishmael put his hand on the grab rail of a tunnel and immediately withdrew it when a laser pulse hit the metal, inches to the right. The laser pulses sounded more like the bullets Ishmael had read about, so concentrated was the ball of energy. If his head had been above the parapet, it would have been holed. He decided to try something.
Citizen C199989! he shouted. Dont shoot!
Have you entered Clonecity? a mechanical voice replied after an instants checking of protocols.
No, Ishmael yelled, at the same time as he stuck his head over the parapet and fired a short burst into the grunts head. The hits only served to spin the Bot around, sending it sprawling into the narrow tunnels wall. But it gave Ishmael enough time to jump into the tunnel and get closer. The grunt turned over with its laser pointing directly at Ishmaels head but it never fired the shot because a shot passed through the joint in its neck, just below where a humans larynx would be. Its laser-arm went limp and the laser fell to the floor.
I have to have one of those! Ishmael said, before pumping another charge into the soldiers neck and slicing off the Bots arm. He picked up the arm which still gripped the lasers trigger.
Well done Ishmael! Jonr exclaimed, coming up behind. The third squad just passed, to the left intersection.
I dont think I will get away with that again, Ishmael declared. Lets see whats ahead.
The eight remaining Rebels split into team to the right and one to the left and ran along the flat tunnel for several hundred metres. Ahead of them, they could hear the continual rattling of the laser guns above the fan duct so they knew they were on the right track. Ishmaels superior vision spotted a heavily armoured bulkhead ahead and he raised his hand. They crept on, trying not to make a sound.
Ishmael suddenly heard the words, Squad Three. Weve taken Intersection Left! come into his head. He had early connected telepathically to Jonr and Chance so he knew where it had come from. He heard Jonr think, Shit. Not now!
Jonr looked at Ishmael. Both thought the same thing; whoever stood on the opposite side of the door probably knew they were there. Ishmael stepped forward and tried the handle of the hatch in the bulkhead. It had been locked tight. Jonr pointed his laser at the control panel and burned it off. Ishmael still couldnt move the hatch so he held up his laser, still in the grip of the grunts arm. Jonr nodded so Ishmael turned the lasers power up to maximum steady beam and began to bore a hole through the door. The hole became a slit and then a slot, around the control panel section of the door. Before long, the section broke loose, fell to the floor with a metallic clang and the door sprung open.
Instantly, a hot rain of laser pulses poured through the hole forcing Ishmael and the others to charge through the door so that they could escape the killing ground. Two grunts with yellow flashes on their shoulders stood with their backs to the laser guns and blasted a hot laser hellfire at them.
Were finished!
But something small and black flew past Ishmaels shoulder and landed at the feet of the Supercity Bots. An instant later, a bright white light overloaded Ishmaels vision sensors and something hard smashed into his face. He put his arms up to defend himself and other hard objects hit his arms, flinging him back against somebody behind him.
***
Silence replaced the concussion that accompanied the flash and Ishmael found himself lying in a pile of bodies. Immediately concerned for his friends, he knelt and turned. Jonrs grinning face met his gaze. Beside the leader, his son shook his head and helped haul a man with a badly sliced arm to stand. Even Chance and Jonr had many small cuts to their faces and hands and Jonr nursed a deep wound to his arm but both still smiled. The dust settled and they inspected the scene. They could hear a roar of cheers from other Rebels outside the fan duct.
Sorry about that Ishmael. We have one grenade per squad. They are our secret weapon and I didnt want to tell you until I felt sure about you. Im not as trusting as Chance or perhaps not as gifted with insight.
Felt sure? For the first time in his life, Ishmael felt as if somebody has hurt him deep inside his body somewhere, so deep that he couldnt reach it and scratch it.
They removed some vital components from the two big laser guns, picked up the two grunts lasers and ran back to the ladder, near the intersection.
At the bottom, they found Jownes, who had begun to come round. Two men picked him up and the squad crossed to the opposite tunnel, a little smaller than the tunnel to the fan. After four hundred metres, Ishmael found what he wanted; a ladder to the side of the track way. They climbed down four levels and Ishmael led them further to the south.
We should be at the next intersection soon. There is a large cooling duct near here. I can hear it.
Soon the others could hear the roar of hot air, coming up from some place far below Supercity. They felt the heat by the time they reached the biggest intersection yet, where Ishmael had first seen the soldiers.
Hey! yelled a familiar voice. Kriss red bush of hair poked over the edge of a ledge, on one side of the vast tunnel. Theyre not here yet! This seemed the best vantage point. Got the guns?
Yeah. They will be here soon! Jonr replied. We got these! He held up the latest Supercity Army lasers. Latest RA issue. Sounds more like the bullets of ancient times when they fire!
Nice. We will have some soon. Have you hacked in already?
No. Ishmael used a workaround!
Ishmael held up his laser, still attached to the Bot arm.
Coming down! Kris yelled.
He set to work, forcing a way to activate the lasers.
Well, this is as far as we go as far as known layout is concerned. They will be here in minutes. Ishmael, what can you pick up on the Presisents network?
Ismaels secondary thought patterns had been completely absorbed in trying to interpret the feeling of inner hurt he had sustained, and he suddenly became aware of it.
Oh. Let me see. I am picking upalmost nothing. It has been secured. I can tell that Armande is on the south side of the City and Frank is in the Operations room of the Government Head Office; I got the schematics from the databases.
Great! So we know practically nothing!
Jonr thought out loud:
All we do know is that these Type 45s are very large calibre super lasers; that is they can cut through anything or fire pulses of almost nuclear sized explosive power, if only once per hour. But they drain half of Supercitys reserve power to do so. We also know the Army has 40,000 Bots, arranged with a supercommander and four adjutants or backups, who wear white flashes, and he commands forty Generals, each wearing a green flash, who command ten Colonels, wearing blue flashes, who command sixteen sergeants, wearing red flashes, who command six grunts, wearing yellow flashes. According to Ish, take a sergeant out and a grunt will replace him, the flash changing colour but I would guess this is not the case for the supercommander and his backups; take them out and the Army will cease to function. If we can find them! I bet the real command protocols are held in a database; theres no way they would be able to cram, say, a Generals functions into a grunt. If only you had found that and taken it out Ishmael!
Sorry Jonr.
Its okay, you have proved your loyalty and thats all I ask from any of my men.
Somehow, this sounded like an insult to Ishmael but some network traffic suddenly sounded off in his head and he exclaimed:
Wait! I can hear the maintenance network. There is a lot of activity. All Bots are being recalled. But at least its still open. Maybe I can contact Fourteen!
Fourteen? Jonr asked.
A Bot, a friend.
Ishmael reached out and inserted himself into the network using a fake address and ID. Within a fraction of a second, he had located Bot Number Fourteen. The other Rebels could hear the conversation using their telepathic links:
Fourteen! Its Ishmael; C199989. Do you remember me?
Hello C199989. Welcome. Are you safe?
Yes. I wont bother you for long. I just wanted to say hello!
The Janitor Bot became aware that Ishmael actually wanted access to its internal memory banks and granted permission. Ishmael homed in on schematics for the maintenance system and asked for a plastic from Jonr, on which he drew a precise map.
Okay, Jonr said, slapping Ishmaels chest. The leader studied the map while Ishmael considered the strange feeling of elation he had experienced when Jonr slapped his chest; a feeling that exactly counterbalanced the feeling of hurt earlier. Nice work. It even has a scale! So the main layout is a big circle, like an expressway, with four spokes running north to south and east to west. We are at the northern end of the north to south spoke, on the rim of the wheel. It looks like this railway runs right round and has exits to Municipal Blocks in each quadrant of the City. Does that make sense Ishmael?
Yes. Responsibility for services is divided into Municipal Quarters.
Great, so they will have to bring the Type 45s down these ramps; there is one only half a mile from here. Problem is that they only have three and I bet they will keep one back, to protect the President. So which ramps?
***
Kris had connected a little black box to the laser but even this would take time to break the encryption.
Lets go north, along the expressway.
The ramp is opposite the north spoke of the maintenance system, Ishmael suggested as they jogged along the tracks. And they know we are here so they will put one here and one on the west side, since that is where I came from; they will realise thats the only part of the system that I am familiar with.
Yes. I will deploy most of my forces in these two locations. Chance! Where are you?
His daughter jogged up behind Jonr and the leader briefed the girl, who turned and set off south.
The squad didnt get far before they heard an ominous sound; that of metallic wheels on metallic tracks.
To the sides! Take cover! Jonr ordered.
A silver-coloured car came into sight a moment later, and stopped. From a hatch at the rear, three squads of Supercity Army soldiers deployed and spread to the entrances of two side-tunnels in classic fireteams of three men. One grunt in each time held a large calibre weapon.
We havent seen those before! Jonr whispered to his men.
The cars doors closed and it accelerated south with more grunts inside.
Advanced party, Kris whispered to Jonr. More will be coming soon. Best to take them out now.
Right. Ishmael, you have the only working laser right now. Can you get a good vantage point above us and take out that weapon; Im betting its a grenade launcher or bazooka.
Ill try Jonr. I am guessing this laser will deactivate itself pretty soon. They must have built in some security contingencies.
We move on Ishmaels first shot. Lets hope theyre confused; they outnumber us already.
Ishmael found a set of pipes that rose, through brackets, to a point three levels above, where they turned over the lip and disappeared. The brackets made good footholds so he could easily climb to a small shelf, which supported smaller pipes. Crawling along this, Ishmael found himself peering over the edge of the shelf and down at the fireteam with the large weapon.  He had chosen a viewpoint high enough to put him beyond their normal field of view and this choice proved correct. None of them looked up though they seemed to know danger drew close. Ishmael heard the sergeant with the red flash give a verbal command:
Move back into cover.
They think I might have penetrated their network!
The two grunts with laser carbines backed into the tunnel and the grunt with the large calibre weapon began to move.
I have to do it now! I am not cut out for killing in cold blood!
Not faced with an immediate threat, Ishmael found it very hard to pull the trigger. As he pressed the alien finger onto the ceramic lever, he felt himself begin to tremble.
Citizens dont tremble! There is something wrong with me. I must do it!
The grunt had almost completely backed under the lintel of the tunnel. In a second, he would be out of sight. Ishmael suddenly pressed the trigger hard. A burst of laser pulses leaped from the barrel but hit pipework behind the SA grunt. The grunt glanced at the damaged pipework but before he realised what had happened, Ishmael had adjusted his elevation and landed four pulses squarely in the face of his enemy. A large hole appeared where the grunts face had been and sparks danced inside the gap. The grunt keeled over and dropped the weapon.
Ishmael heard his own team surge forward just as he burned a large hole in the breech of the weapon. He relaxed his grip and waited for any chance to cover the others. Jonr and the others ran to the corner of the tunnel and a firefight broke out. Ishmael could not see any of the enemy on his side of the tunnel but two grunts from the opposite team were sent from their squad to assist the SA grunts so Ishmael took these out with a short burst each.
This forced the other two SA squads to pay attention. One took up a defensive position in the smaller tunnel on the other side of the expressway while the other team split into two; one crossing north of them, the other to the south. They had also spotted Ishmael. Within seconds, he heard the sound of metal on the pipe brackets behind him.
Time to go!
Ishmael saw a single pipe, which ran up the side of the side of the side tunnel recess, to his right. It rose at least three levels but he couldnt be sure it would hold his weight. But there seemed no point going down. He stood up and carefully placed his toe on a tiny bracket. It bent under his weight, almost making him slip. He shouldered his weapon, still gripped by an arm, and held the pipe tightly. It pulled away from the wall slightly but he obstinately began to climb.
The pipework seemed so shaky that Ishmael could only climb one level before the noise on the ladder stopped. He stepped off onto a ledge, slick with sludge and knelt down. Gripping the corner of a panel with his left hand, he peeped over the lip of the ledge. Fifteen feet below him, the SA grunt crept forward, unaware of his jeopardy.
Im good at this!
Ishmael waited for the Bot to come directly beneath him but this proved a mistake. A grunt spotted Ishmael and told the vulnerable Bot, at the same time opening fire on Ishmael. The Bot below looked up.
Ishmaels finger had already been squeezing the laser trigger so he put a few shots into the face of the Bot and swung the barrel towards the distant squad.
A shower of sparks and burning smell told Ishmael he had been hit. He could see a messy hole in his left arm, just below the last wound but he had already been diving to the ledge for cover. His face smacked into the hard material and he began to roll off the narrow ledge.  Something slammed into his leg, just as he fell into space. He hit the wider ledge below, breaking a pipe, which spewed a cold liquid all over him. He grabbed the pipe to stop himself falling further but his fist closed around the wrist of the terminated Bot instead. The gushing liquid, coolant of some kind, made Ishmael slide further over the lip of the ledge. He clung to the dead Bots wrist and pulled the dead machine down with him when he fell.
Both of them crashed to the floor of the tunnel, the dead Bot falling over Ishmael. Instantly, hot laser pulses slammed into the dead Bots carcass, one slamming though Ishmaels already damaged leg. There seemed nowhere to go.
***
Under the dead Bot, Ishmael listened for the pulse that would carry with it his own termination. He heard something else, the yell of Charge! by a familiar voice.
An instant later, the tunnel seemed to erupt in a great gout of orange and yellow flame. A wave of hot air curled the ends of Ishmaels hair and singed his eye-lashes. A similar flash followed, moments later, followed by silence.
Ishmael dared not move. Somebody pulled the carcass off him and the smiling face of Jonr looked down at him. The leaders eyelashes and eyebrows had also been singed.
Can you stand? Jonr said.
What happened? Ishmael stood and saw the terminated carcasses of twelve SA grunts just a few yards away.
It was close. We wiped out the other squad and they had some rather tasty grenades. Two of them took this lot out just before they reached you!
I dont think I can stand!
Let me take a look, Kris suggested.
They dragged Ishmael to one of the side tunnels and Kris ripped off Ishmaels legging:
Its a wreck, Im afraid. You wont use that again.
Ishmael looked to Jonr.
I dont know, Ish, Jonr muttered. Let me thinkKris, cant we use a leg from one of these grunts? They look very similar to designs Tri-mex submitted for a new range of androids, based on the C-class. Maybe it will fit?
Could be. Do we have time?
Dont know but we need Ishmael. Give it a try.
I need tools! Lots of tools!
Check the car.
Between the cars axles, they found a range of backup supplies, including what, during Earth wars, would have been called a First Aid kit; basically a large toolbox and supply of spare parts. Kris removed the leg of a Bot within ten minutes and started to cut into Ishmaels leg.
Ouch! Ishmael whispered through clenched teeth, watching red liquid dripping from the incisions. Kris quickly exposed the gleaming carbon and alloy joint, which Ishmael saw with mute curiosity. You know, until today, I still thought I might beIm sorry, Im confused. I mean; I thought I might have an organic body. I guess theres no doubt now! I guess I would be unconscious if I had one.
Lie still.
Shame you took out that bazooka, Jonr said. It would have been useful but at least we have two more. We need the access codes though!
I can only work on one thing at a time! Kris retorted.
Grab all the weapons you can carry, men! How long Kris?
An hour, at least!
Okay. We dont have time. Get him on the car. Well risk a train ride. Get the dead grunts out of sight. Carry the wounded onto the car; were leaving!
Three Rebels had died, two more had serious wounds but could walk. They all piled onto the silver car and Kris put it into reverse, calling out:
Get down! More SA on the ground!
Everyone bent down below the level of the windows and they passed six SA squads without hearing a shot fired.
Must think it can run on automatic! Kris declared. More coming. Jesus! There are swarms of them!
They knew they had almost reached the North Ramp when Jonr saw an undefended side tunnel and ordered:
 Kris, stop the car! We have to find cover for a while. We are close enough to watch for the Type 45 now.
The five survivors disembarked and headed into the side tunnel while another Rebel drove the car south to relay all the new Intel to other squads. Three men carried Ishmael, just behind Kris.
Where to Ishmael? Jonr asked.
Look for a ladder or an elevator, if you can find one that works. Go up!
Right.
The third elevator they found worked so they took it to a narrow access tunnel, three levels up and crept to a grill that looked out into the expressway, just under the roof.
Cut the grate off Ish! Jonr told one of his men, who pointed Ishmaels laser at the obstruction and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened.
Dead! the man declared.
Okay, weve been lucky today, Jonr declared. Theres a room, back down the tunnel. Well hole up there for a few hours; get some rest. Somebody get rid of that grill.
***
While some of the men ate rations and rested, Kris worked away, attaching the soldier Bots leg to Ishmaels stump. The main ball joint seemed simple enough but a maze of connectors and fluid transit tubes required more thought. After an exhausting hour of labour, Kris stitched up the wound and slapped Ishmaels other thigh:
Good as new! Lets look at that arm. Not so bad. The shot went straight through. Just cut a few wires. Ill soon have them reconnected.
Ten minutes later, Ishmael stood unsteadily on the new leg and flexed his damaged arm.
Arm feels okay, he announced, But the leg feels strange; disconnected.
It will take some getting used to. I have to crack these access codes or well all have no legs!
Ishmael walked up and down to try the new leg and went to find Jonr:
The new leg! he declared, turning it this way and that to show the leader.
Yeah, looks fine. Put some leggings on!
Oh sorry. I forget about the clones inhibitions!
For the last time, were not clones!
Sorry Jonr. I will find some leggings.
No Ish, Im sorry, for my bad temper. It hasnt been a good start to this. I fear the worst.
But we have gone so far and we have a good position.
Yes and two men will have to go back for treatment. We have suffered more than 50% losses already; if the other squads are suffering the same.
Give me a few minutes.
Ishmael hobbled back to the expressway, took an intact pair of fatigue trousers from one of the SA carcasses and returned to Jonr:
I wanted to ask you about something that has been bothering me Jonr.
Go on.
First, tell me about the slide of men into apathy as a result of cracking time travel.
Ha! Ish, I do believe you would make a great diplomat! Distracting the man from his worries, eh?
Yaela, my girlfriend, scores very highly on the charm scale. I learned a lot from her.
Do you hope to see her again?
Yes, though I dont think there is much chance of me seeing her while we are still both alive.
I know what you mean. Well, as you know, worm holes gave us one means of time travel, way back in the Third Millennium and special recording devices gave us a way to see back in time. But we still couldnt see forward in time or back or forward for just a short interval. Then Ito discovered vector time; projections of time using quantum computers  their ability to calculate result sets predetermined by the verifier  that were accurate to .0001% tolerance up to a time interval of almost three days!
Blankers, user-controlled replicants, were already in use and people quickly employed them to live vicarious lives for them up to three days in the past or future. As long as they could stay hidden, the controller of the clone could still function but avoid all consequences of the Law! Work became a joke and crime escalated. In fact, it proved one of the factors that led to the final, total collapse of Capitalism. But you said you wanted to ask me about something?
Yes. But Im not sure how to put it. I had several long discussions with Chance about evolution and Conservation. He showed me one of your farms; where they are cremating human bodies for fertilizer. It shocked me. He began to convince me that Citizens are not really the benevolent beings they thought they were. And you have almost convinced me that humans created Citizens.
Shocked, they; these words convince me there is something non-android about you, Ishmael. We really must do some tests on you when we finish this, if we survive. Maybe we can even take you apart!
Ishmael scowled at Jonrs before continuing:
We believe ourselves to be organic, the ultimate and original species, but I have searched my memories and now I can find no evidence that I ever had an organic body, even as a minor. And when Kris opened up my leg, it became obvious what my body really is; artificial. But my brain could still be organic, or at least some part of it. What I cant understand is why, or how, we could be deceived by our society or State into believing that we are organic? It seems to me that my memory has been wiped, by somebody, of any memories of surgical procedures in my life. Who could do this and why? My model of the Universe cannot explain this!
Your reality?
Yes, my reality, or one of my main realities, as you would put it.
Ha! Ah, well now we come to the strangest tale of all. Mind you, this is all rumour; the truth is wrapped up in layers of official secrets. But my grandfather told me he heard a rumour that when the Alliance broke up and humans chose instead to be ruled by androids, they took a last precaution to safeguard the existence of our Culture.  They programed a special range of androids so that they would rule the C-class androids in a culture built around the myth that the all androids were created before man and that, in fact, they created man. These special androids have ruled our culture ever since. Your President is certainly one. But, for obvious reasons, they dont believe the myth themselves. It sounds like they have been controlling your memory so that you need not question this myth.
Of course the C-class androids are different; nobody knows who created them or why, but they have always believed they are the progenitors of all men, whom they choose to call clones. I guess somebody programed themyou, that way. Some say it was the Russians, some the Germans and some believe America did it at the height of its powers.
I dont believe any of it! I was beginning to believe many of your ideas Jonr but I cant believe this! But there is something you should knowit might convince you that you are wrong.
Here it comes! the Rebel on watch shouted.
Everyone roused and crawled to the grill. Ishmael and Jonr peered over the lookouts shoulders. Far to their left, in the expressway, they saw a silver maintenance car pushing a flat waggon before it. On the waggon sat an enormous device with a barrel, whose bore would comfortably accommodate a man, if it were a conventional gun.
The Type 45, I presume, Jonr whispered. Look at that red lens on the end of the barrel. A red eye blinked like a sleeping dragon, once every second. Behind the car, walked a battalion of SA soldiers, each armed to the teeth.
Looks like it is primed and ready to go! Kris whispered, poking his head through a gap beneath them.
Yeah, but were not! the Rebel leader replied. Have you got those codes sorted?
Almost. Just a few more minutes. We have fourteen of the sixteen placeholders. Its neat; a different encryption for each placeholder.
Dont want to hear. Just do it. We have to get out there and stop this thing.
I dont think we have a chance, in front of it, but if we can get behind it and disable the car and wagon. Ishmael suggested.
The rest of you, come on! Jonr whispered, crawling past the rest of his men.
***
Jonr led his men into the expressway, only seconds before the rolling wagon reached them. Watching the approaching machine from the corner, he could not have timed his attack better. The Type 45s operators swung the great laser gun to point at the Rebels but they were too close and under its greatest angle of depression. Even if the SA grunts had opened fire, they would have only caused an explosion so close that it would have disabled the gun and killed them. Instead, fifty-six SA grunts, eight of them with red flashes, poured through the doors of the silver car, onto the waggon to defend the artillery laser.
With me! yelled Jonr, leaping onto the flatbed, under the barrel. The two remaining able men, followed by Ishmael, leaped onto the waggon and opened fire on the SA grunts. The Rebel lasers were hopelessly underpowered and Jonr found himself grappling with a yellow-flashed grunt while his two comrades got blasted to pieces behind him. The silver car kept on rolling
Jonr! Ishmael yelled, poking his head over the side of the waggon and picking up a laser from a fallen Rebel. He rammed the poleaxe though the neck of an enemy, We have to get out of here. Its no use.
I have to. Jonr began, turning his laser round. Agh! He screamed as two laser pulses went through his leg. He had emptied the whole chamber into a grunt to no effect other than to make the grunt check its chest for damage with a vacant expression. Kill one! Jonr finished, thrusting the poleaxe through the grunts neck, just as Ishmael had shown him. The grunts mouth opened and a single spark leaped from it before it slumped over. Jonr left the lasers poleaxe embedded in the grunts neck and rolled over the side of the waggon, dropping to the tunnel floor.
The waggon had rolled opposite their side tunnel and while Jonr tried to avoid being crushed by the wheels, Ishmael ducked underneath to help his friend. A hail of laser pulses pinged off the metallic wheels and axles.
Give me that! Jonr shouted, grabbing Ishmaels laser. He turned it to maximum and pumped all its remaining charge into one of the axle ends of the waggon before ramming the dead laser into the gap between the axle end and the wheel. Lets go!
The gap between the waggon and the side tunnel was no more than four feet but even crossing this, several shots took off Ishmaels hair and one of his ears while another ripped a flap of flesh from Jonrs back. Shots still slammed into the the side tunnel wall when they reached the elevator and ascended to their hideout. The waggon rolled on, now making a squealing sound with the damaged axle.
The two wounded men faced the door with their lasers when Jonr knocked after giving the password:
Cant be too careful! one of them joked, putting down the crude weapon.
Kris! Theyre coming! Jonr whispered.
Its done! Kris replied, holding a laser aloft. He threw it to Jonr and attached the black box to a second laser. Seconds later, he threw this to Ishmael, who swung round to take up a defensive position beside Jonr.
The elevator doors hissed open and two SA grunts leapfrogged each other along the corridor in a classic offensive move.
Shut the hatch! Kris whispered, holding up a heavy coil of blue electrical cable. Jonr grinned and slammed the hatch shut. Ishmael forced a rusty latch into place. I got one of the wounded men to find it; thought it might be handy. He peered out of the grill opening, down into the expressway. Phew, hundreds of them but mostly gone. Another minute! Laser fire pinged off the other side of the hatch and Ishmael found himself counting off seconds. Okay, lets go!
Kris wrapped the cable round his back and abseiled down the expressway wall, with Jonr close behind.
Ill go last, Ishmael told the two wounded men. Im not sure it will hold my weight.
Here take this! said one the men, tossing a laser. Kris has a spare. Turn it to max and lock the safety-catch. It will fuse and blow in thirty secondsroughly!
Thanks.
As the last man disappeared out of the opening, Ishmael set the laser to explode. A red line appeared around the hatch lock and extended to a red hot slit. Ishmael counted for a few seconds and pressed the safety-catch lock. He ran for the opening and climbed down the cable. Beneath his feet, he could see his waiting friends but the cable jerked so he guessed it would soon break. He quickened his pace and fell the last fifteen feet when the cable snapped. Contracting his legs to form a spring, in a way that must have been programmed into him, he landed heavily and fell over.
Nothing damaged! he announced, when the others hauled him to his feet. He followed the others as they broke into a slow jog, heading south. Both Kris and Jonr supported a wounded man each.
Let me! Ishmael said to Jonr. He hoisted the most wounded man to his shoulders and found that he could easily carry the mans weight at a steady jog.
***
Jonr and his surviving squad didnt have to go far before they met Supercity Armys rear-guard. Jonr kept the enemy squads at the limit of their visible range. One soldier caught Ishmaels eye; surrounded by four other grunts wherever he went:
Look at him Jonr. I think he is some kind of commander, perhaps a general. See how those Bots around him always move to defend him?
Yes. Youre right!
Wait! Look. A Bot came running back to the defended Bot from the front ranks. Ishmael zoomed in to the limit of his vision. That one that just arrived; I think he has a blue flash; a Colonel. Hes spotted us. He is talking with the other one. Look, now hes running forward and two squads are peeling off into side tunnels.
Trouble!
Yes, but if one of us can get a good shot at that one; the general.
Better be you. Your vision is best and your hand never shakes!
It does actually, recently.
Theyre stopping; wonder why. Listen Ish, while we distract them, get up there somewhere. Take a shot. This time, I dont think well get a chance to regroup. If you survive, get back to the first intersection and well meet you there! Jonr held out his hand; the human gesture of friendship that even Citizens knew. Ishmael took his hand and shook it. Kris and the others shook his hand too and then he ran into a side tunnel.
Ishmael quickly found a smaller intersection of tunnels but stopped in his tracks; a deafening boom shook the foundations of the city and an instant later, the tunnel flashed white around him, followed by red, yellow and purple. Two SA grunts with yellow flashes turned a corner in front of him and he took both the unprepared soldiers with a short burst each. A shockwave surged past Ishmael, rocking him on his feet. 
The first shot of that Type 45. More Rebels must have arrived. I have to move faster.
He turned into the second tunnel and ran until he estimated he had gone ahead of the SA general. Another boom nearly breaking his grip on a ladder he had begun to climb.
Three levels up, not far under the roof of the expressway, he crawled forward to a good sniper position. His encounter with the two grunts had alerted the enemy and he found hundreds of soldier faces scanning the walls for him. Two pairs spotted him and all eyes turned to pick out the intruder. A fraction of a second later, hundreds of laser barrels pointed at his face.
But Ishmael knew his target before they did and he already had the green flash of a general in his sights. The Bots around their leader closed in. Whether because they did not expect their enemy to have such good long-range vision or because their tactical programming still had some deficiencies, Ishmael still had line-of-sight on the Generals neck for the fraction of a second he needed. He pulled the trigger and ducked. A solid sheet of laser fire scorched the air where his head had been and burned a hole over a meter wide in the wall behind him. Burned-through pipes gushed liquids, some of which ignited instantly, further adding to the conflagration around him. Ishmael dived though a wall of fire and ran back to the ladder.
At the bottom, he turned right and ran until he thought he had gone ahead of the artillery piece. He stopped at an intersection and breathed deeply. He flexed his new mech leg.
Not too bad after all. Shame I wont have long to get used to it!
He turned right and ran out into the expressway, into a full-scale war.
***
In front and to his left, Ishmael saw Rebels, as far as the tunnel stretched south. To his right, the laser canon stood still, flanked by line upon line of SA grunts. Ishmael dived to the left, narrowly avoiding a hail of SA laser fire, some from the Rebels who didnt recognise him. He stumbled through the ranks of the Rebels, calling out:
Who is in charge?
A dark-haired woman suddenly emerged in front of him and grabbed his arm:
Ishmael. Is Jonr okay?
Mira! Youre safe. I am glad. Jonr still lived when I last saw him, a few minutes ago. What is going on?
The laser wagon seems to be broken. They have some grunts trying to fix it. We are trying to organise an assault on the 45 but we are being cut down like corn.
Ishmael watched as whole ranks of Rebels were cut down in front of him. A blinding flash of light burst from the red eye of the great laser cannon and took out a narrow line of men, fifty ranks deep. Rebels flowed forward, into the gap, yelling cries of Death to Supercity!
This is no good, Ishmael told Mira. If the gun cannot move, you should fall back, out of range.
But its such an opportunity! We have to take it now!
With what?
Watch. We are going to try something.
Mira vanished into the ranks and Ishmael tried to pick off a few SA grunts while he waited.
He had no idea what Mira had planned but when he heard her voice, above all others, ordering, Part ranks! and he saw three men run into the slot with grenades, he guessed her intention.
The men ran out from the first rank, into a field of dead bodies; fallen corn stalks. The blood lay thick and body parts tripped them as they tried to cross the gap and get close enough to lob the grenades.
Ishmael found himself whispering Oh no. as the first man fell, followed by the second, before either had launched their grenades. The third man lived long enough to throw his but it fell ten metres short of the Type 45 waggon. A fourth man came and a fifth, both falling before throwing their grenades. The sixth Rebel lobbed his and it flew in its spellbinding arc towards the laser barrel, hypnotising all that saw it. It detonated only a few metres from the barrel but when the white flash and eruption of debris cleared, the barrel appeared unharmed. Only some of the flat waggons decking and a few Bots had been destroyed.
The last man had some respite from laser fire while the SA watched the horrific flight of the previous grenade. He reached further than any before his legs were cut from under him and his left arm severed. He retained consciousness just long enough to lob his grenade but missed his target. The grenade exploded near the front right axle of the waggon. All eyes turned to watch as the waggon buckled and the Type 45 slid towards the ground. There it stopped, at a crazy angle but not disabled.
We are out of grenades! Mira yelled, running up to Ishmael.
From the opposite side of the expressway, a Rebel cheer went up, but, Ishmael thought, not for the damage they had inflicted on the waggon. A minute later, Jonr and Kris reached Mira and Ishmael. Jonr limped up to Mira, embraced her and yelled:
Retreat! They cannot move for now.
Rebels around them echoed the cry of, Retreat! and ranks of men began to back away from the SA.
***
Together, the northern contingent of the Rebel army began steadily moving south in retreat. After only a few minutes, they passed the expressway, which led to the hub of Supercitys maintenance system. Jonr cast a wistful eye at it and wondered out loud:
I wonder if we should leave some men here.
Continuing south, they met isolated squads of Rebels, coming the other way, one of them containing Chance. She ran up to her parents and clutched them:
I have news! I wanted to come to the front but I ran into this squad and this stupid commander has hung on to me ever since!
Remind me to thank him! her father replied. What news?
Rebels now hold the south and east ramp. Only the west and north are not ours. Some squads are close to the crossroads at the centre of it all. I have been there! Dad. I climbed a wall and saw the SA there. They are very strong!
But no Type 45s?
No. Not yet.
You did well. Did you find out where that manhole cover led?
Yes!
Ishmael had forgotten the covers and felt impressed with Chances work.
Great! Well? Jonr asked.
There are loads of them; they go straight down, a long way. Many small tunnels lead off them, some towards Scaffold City. I think its an old sewerage system.
Hm. Sound right to you Ish?
I dont know. I will ask Number Fourteen. But however hard he tried, Ishmael could not contact Number Fourteen anymore.
They reached the second intersection, where they had first emerged into the maintenance system. Alarms could still be faintly heard blaring in the distance. A commander ran up to Jonr and told him:
All of our army is in the system now sir!
Good. Jonr turned to his army and announced, We camp here for tonight! I want defensive walls, sentries, lookouts and snipers; anything to protect our base. I want the routes to the east and west ramps strengthened and runners to be stationed north and west of here. Tomorrow, we will take the whole system and Supercity! A cheer went up from his men. He turned to Kris and said:
I want you to get some men down those shafts; see if they go under Scaffold City and if there is a way out, either into this main system of Scaffold City. We may need an escape route.
Jonr turned back to Ishmael, Chance and Mira and said:
Come with me! Mara, do you have lipstick?
Of course! Doesnt every woman when you dont have hologloss lips?
He led them back to the first intersection, at the end of the tunnel that led to the fan duct. Three alarms still blared and red light flashed on and off in the tunnel. Jonr raised his laser and shot out the alarms. The last one made a wheezing sound before finally falling silent.
I have been dying to do that! Jonr declared. Lipstick!
Mira handed him the small tube. He strode to one of the signs which read, Warning. Danger of clone attacks! and crossed out the words. Underneath, he wrote, This way to Scaffold City, home of humans.
Clones, my ass! he added. Lets go.
We need to look at that leg, Mira said, kissing Jonr.
***
A tight bandage on Jonrs leg had become sodden with blood. Mira gently unwound it and looked at the wound. Didnt hit bone. Youll live but it needs cauterizing; cut one of the arteries. She wound a laser up to full charge and aimed it at the severed artery. Jonr gasped as waves of pain crashed over him.
Feel so tired, he murmured, closing his eyes.
Its good that he sleeps. I am hardly purple myself!
Mum! Its not good to try and sound cool! Chance said, lying down between her mother and father. Youre too old! While Chance clasped her father for comfort, Mira put her arm around both and they fell asleep.
A few Rebels were still eating and talking but many were grabbing some well-earned sleep.
Ishmael stood guard over them, not able to rest. The network traffic in his head hummed like a giant, angry wasp; an insect he had only seen in history recordings. He had been listening to it for some time, trying to pick out anything useful when he found himself becoming sleepy. Suddenly a female voice blared in his head; Revolution! Were all going to suffer! Ishmael jerked awake.
Sounds like a Citizen. But a malfunctioning one!
He homed in on the epicentre of the confusion and heard more voices, all whispering Clone revolution! or Uprising!
Later, the panic seemed to die down somewhat, only for the words of panic to be replaced by whispers of a, Secret Weapon.
Kris and his men returned after four hours. Kris talked with some of the sentries, strode over and woke Jonr:
The 45 must be fixed. They are coming south and not more than an hour away. We found out where the tunnels go. Yes, they are old sewers, dating back to when everyone lived in Supercity and the cavern only held animals and crops. Some of the system goes right under the cavern and some of it leads in, towards two great, parallel channels, sloping north to south, under the centre of Supercity. I didnt hang around but there must be exits into the maintenance system.
Great work! So we now have an escape route. And are there exits into the cavern?
Ah, that we couldnt find out. I would need more time.
Alright, we have no time. Only use those in an emergency. As much as possible, when the time comes, lead survivors into the system under Supercity. Supercity; got that!
Yes, but what are you talking about? We are going in and I am coming with you!
Trust me. You are my deputy.
Kris shook his head but remained silent.
Now! Jonr continued. While there is time, I have an idea we can try! Did either of you notice those grills in the roof? Ishmael and Kris shook their heads. There is one just over there! He pointed to a dark shape that only Ishmael could see in the very apex of the vaulted ceiling above the expressway. Kris walked in its direction until he could make it out clearly.
Hadnt noticed it! Kris said.
Well, I noticed one yesterday; they are about every half mile. Ideal for dropping a grenade right on top of that 45. Ishmael and I are going to take about a dozen grenades and take it out for once and for all. Kris, I am leaving you in charge here. Defend the tunnel as far north as you can but retreat rather than lose more than 10% of your force; we have lost too many already. When it is clear there is no other way, get everyone into the sewer system and go for the centre. Whoever takes the centre needs less forces to defend it but you cannot fail. There will be no retreat so it could become a trap.
A teenage runner came in from the south, interrupting Jonr by shouting, We have lost the western tunnel. The big laser has wiped out our forces! Where is Jonr?
I feared it! Jonr said, standing. Time to go.
Ishmael and Jonr equipped themselves with some armour, three lasers each and several bags containing grenades. Saying goodbye to their comrades, they headed north.
***
As they moved along the expressway, Ishmael and Jonr passes squads of bedraggled and wounded Rebels, heading south. Jonr pepped the men up with talk of victory and defiance but Ishmael could now tell the difference between bravado and honesty. He saw a weary look in the leaders eyes.
Fearing it might take a long time to find the way to one of the grills, Jonr turned into a side tunnel at an early opportunity. It didnt take Ishmael long to locate a promising tunnel on the top level. They followed it, eventually crawling on hands and knees until they reached one of the grills. Jonr peered down:
Woo. I always did get a bit of vertigo but that is sickening! Dont look!
Ishmael looked straight down.
I feel nothing! he replied.
They took out the grenades and waited.
Below them, squads of weary Rebels streamed south. Few of them spoke and many were wounded. Jonr felt tempted to shout encouragement to them but had to keep quiet. After an hour, the squads thinned out, until there were none. Not long after that, the front line of SA grunts appeared. Ishmael and Jonr remained completely silent.
One hour passed and then two. Jonr fidgeted and eventually could bear it no more:
Somethings wrong Ish. We havent seen any SA for nearly thirty minutes. Do you think the Type 45 is coming?
I dont know. Lets give it another thirty minutes and then go down.
Alright.
When the time had elapsed and they had rode the elevator back to the ground floor, they found themselves in a silent tunnel.
You could hear a bat fart! Jonr joked.
You think so? Oh, a joke.
You dont have jokes? Jonr asked, heading north.
No.
Oh.
They crept from cover to cover, moving steadily north, until they reached the north spoke.
Careful Jonr, Ishmael warned, as the leader strode confidently into the vast intersection. Jonr ignored him. A slit of white light suddenly came from behind a generator, sending both diving for their lives. Ishmael had been close to a huge junction box and crawled behind it. He peered round it and saw Jonr lying in the middle of the tunnel, with only two carcasses of dead SA grunts to protect him.
One of the enemy poked his head above the generator and fired a short burst, taking out Jonrs laser and only just missing the bag of grenades. The leader had two lasers strapped to his back but he wouldnt be able to reach them before the grunt could shoot him. Knowing this, the grunt strode confidently towards his prey and stood over him.
I have orders to take any senior Rebels as prisoners. You are one, the grunt said.
Ishmael didnt have time to wonder how the grunt knew this but took aim with his laser instead. Another sliver of white light stopped him.
The SA grunt toppled to the ground and sparks flew from another head poking above the generator before that grunt too slumped over. Ishmael looked in the direction, from which the fire had come and saw a human head pop up from a ledge, twenty feet up.
Hey! the head yelled. We have been waiting to take those two snipers out. You acted as a bait, you idiot! Thanks!
Jonr got to his feet, wiped himself down and broke into a deep, rumbling laugh. Ha Jonr, your leader at your service Rebel!
Oh shit!
The men on the ledge climbed down and walked towards Ishmael and Jonr.
Sorry sir! I didnt know it was you! the man explained.
No problem! You just saved my life! Where is the 45?
 Sir! the Rebel said, saluting. Squad 82 reporting. Our commander is dead. I am Telmur. The Type 45 turned down the spoke. They are moving towards the centre of the wheel. What are your orders?
Jonr slapped the mans shoulders. At least your morale hasnt waned Telmur. I remember you from one of the briefings. East, you say. That is strange. If they had continued south, they could have driven us back into the cavern. Or at least that is what I thought they intended! Hm. This could be a blunder on their part. Well Ish, this means our task is pointless, for now. Hm. No point heading south either. But I am wondering why they went to the hub. There must be something worth protecting there. Mind you, if they had both Type 45s there, they could use them both more efficiently; defend the whole system.
They must have taken there for a reason other than the tactical, Ishmael suggested. As you said, the hub is as strong position but only in defence. It could become a trap!
Unless whoever is calling the shots is either an idiot or scared of something. HmI think we should go there. How many men do you have Telmur?
The remnants of six squads; twelve men sir.
Okay. Put somebody in charge of four and leave them here. The youngest will have to be a runner. I want to know about anything that moves though here. The rest, come with me.
***
At the second intersection, Kris found that the Rebel army had its back against the wall. He finally ordered them into the sewer system, and from there, they spread out towards the great sewer tunnels under the centre of Supercity.
In the Presidents office, panic began to set in. Frank had been leading all operations while the president toured Supercity, ostensibly to glad-hand Citizens in the run-up to another election. But in reality he felt terrified. Armande One, as had most politicians by the time they reached a senior rank, had arranged for his telepath circuits to be removed; excess traffic overwhelmed their senses but, more importantly, the security risks were too great. It also looked cool to be holding a com disk in ones hand when visiting constituents; the common touch. Frank had to call him to tell him that one of the two Type 45s sent into the maintenance system had been slightly damaged.
Are you kidding me? That thing is supposed to be invisible! The Army is supposed to be invincible. I am coming back to HQ. Prepare all our defensive systems and deploy the third Type 45 to defend our offices!
But sir! That will create confusion andthe wrong impression!
Put out a rumour that there is Rebellion! Understand? That will work in our favour! Is Infinity nearly ready?
Yes sir!
Good. You know what to do.
***
Jonr and his men found themselves approaching the hub after four hours of fast marching. They were all weary so Jonr pulled them over for a rest.
Do we go back to the main spoke tunnel? Telmur half-suggested. This tunnel twists and turns like crazy! We must have walked twice the distance.
Yes, youre right, Jonr replied. We havent heard much from the SA. I think they are concentrating all their forces in one place. Perhaps they dont want us to know theyre here!
Jonr led them back to the main spoke tunnel and the squad leapfrogged towards the hub of the great wheel. The point man suddenly stopped and held up his hand. The whole squad stopped and shifted to some cover while the man explained:
Ahead. I can see them. They are arranged in ranks. Somebody needs to take a better look.
Up there! Ishmael suggested, pointing to a high pipe-ledge.
Lets go! Jonr agreed. Both men doubled back until they could find a way up to the ledge. Ishmaels superior vision picked out the details of the SA deployment:
Ranks, maybe 100 deep, going back to an inner circle. You are probably right. Only the northern Type 45 is there now but I can see they have made provision for a second; the one from the west. They are gathered around three central towers of pipes and crawl ways. There is a clear space of perhaps two hundred metres around the tower. Wait. I can see at least two of the Generals walking into the space. They are looking up at something; something in the pipe-tower.
Is there a way we could reach it; this tower?
No. I cannot see a possible route. But if we could get to the tower, we might be able to climb it. There is plenty of cover in that complexity of pipes.
You are beginning to sound like a sixth grade poet!
Oh, thank you Jonr. I have what might be called an idea.
Well, go on, while the goings good.
When I downloaded the schematics for the maintenance system, I also took the liberty of downloading the schedules of vehicles in the system. Perhaps this could be of help? They still have to maintain the City.
Okay Ish. Let me do the creative thinking! Let me know what you know. Do any vehicles pass through here periodically?
Searching. Yes! One of those silver cars normally passes through here at 11 am, every day. It stops and a Bot checks the pipe tower for any signs of damage. But I am guessing it wont run today.
No, but they might not know that! Jonr pointed to the glut of SA grunts in the hub. Lets go down.
Jonr explained his plan to Telmur:
We need a diversion and a maintenance car. I want you to send a runner down the west tunnel to find any squads able to make a token attack on this lot here. Send two other men to find a car we abandoned in the expressway yesterday. If it still runs, bring it back to about half mile from here and report back. Oh, and get me two silver suits if you can. Got it?
And put two dead Rebels in the car, Ishmael suggested.
Jonr stared at Ishmael, who added:
I will explain later.
Do it! Jonr ordered.
Dead bodies? Alright sir. On my way!
***
Jonr and Ishmael huddled together in an alcove to plan their next move.
Well go in; you will drive and I will be under the car. When the diversion starts, you and I will climb up that tower. But what the hell is up there thats so important? Thats what I want to know. Tell me again about what the Bots have to check on the tower?
It says the Bot checks the ladder for any sign of damage. Thats all it says!
The ladder? You didnt say that before! Chrissakes Ish. You are getting too human. That sort of details is crucial! Are you sure it says ladder?
Yes. Sorry. I was paraphrasing to save time.
Jonr stared at Ishmael for a moment before sitting down again and exhaling:
Okay, so its something about the ladder. That means somebody or something must have to go up or down it. Maybe it leads somewhere important. We have to go up that ladder and see where it goes Ish.
Yes Jonr. I will go with you.
Sorry, I didnt even ask you; I am just so determined that my people will getfreedom, for the first time. The bodies?
The SA will detect a human by your telepathic noise and your bio signals. The bodies will cover this.
Even dead ones?
Yes. The body is not fully dead in clo-humans for some time. There is always some traffic.
Hm. You were going to tell me something earlierto change my mind.
Oh, its nothing. Just something about the C-class.
No, tell me. We have nothing to do but wait now.
Well, its something we never talk about. Its something very personal; like the sex that clones avoid talking about.
Go on.
Well, we have oh I am embarrassed to say itwe have, inside us, what we call am M-tag; a Makers Tag. Itsvery precious and personal to us. There are only 200,000 and will never be another and they are passed on from one Citizen to another. So my parents tags are out there somewhere, in other Citizens.
I have heard about these tags; very valuable, arent they?
Yes. They are made from 5 ounces of pure Platinum 190. Even in the Third Millennium, that isotope was valued at more than a trillion and a half dollars per ounce and there was nowhere near enough left in the Earths crust to make another 10 tags.
How much is a trillion and a half dollars? I am not familiar with money!
Each tag, even then, would have been worth more than Supercity. Some believe there never could have been enough Platinum 190 in the Earths crust to make 200,000 tags; there is none on Marsone, Marstoo or Earthtoo. The Ischians and Timpoids valued Platinum 190 above all other metals in trade so you can imagine how rare it is in this Universe. That is one reason why some speculate that Citizens came from Universe B. The central museum in Supercity holds an M-tag in its archives that dates back to 900 AD; yet more proof, they say, that we created man.
Ishmael looked sad at the telling of his own story and Jonr pondered it for a moment before replying:
Where is this M-tag embedded?
Near the heart. That is, if we have a heart. I no longer believe it. But that tag will be there.
But dont you see that this would not be a natural act of evolution. It has to prove that something or somebody made Citizens?
Yes, I am beginning to see that. But if we win and get through to Supercity, I will take you to the Museum and show you the tag.
Its a deal. Now, lets some rest. You havent slept for days Ish.
I dont think I need it until this is all over.
Telmur found them asleep an hour later. He let them sleep for another hour while he waited for the approach of the Rebel Army.
Jonr, wake up! he whispered. Time to go.
Um. I was dreaming of walking in green fields on Earthtoo with Mira and Chance. Oh well, another day at the office. Whats the score?
The car is parked as you ordered. Its a little worse for wear. It only runs up to about five mph, there are a few holes but we patched it as best we could. We couldnt contact the main Rebel force but we found about ten squads of men; all told, eighty men. They will attack in three waves, in one hour and five minutes.
The suits?
The best we could do was these; found them in the wreck of another car.
Telmur held up two suits, both ripped by laser fire.
Theyll have to do. Well keep the ripped sides away from view. Lets go Ish. Good luck Telmur. See you in Supercity. Oh, and try to cover us if we reach the ladder!
Yessir!
Ishmael and Jonr took a steady stroll to find the car, parked down the tracks some way. The holes had been patched with biomet and sprayed silver.
Best get into the suits now, Jonr suggested. When they had dressed, he laughed at Ishmaels appearance:
All you need is a flashing light on your head and you could be a Janitor Bot!
Janitor Bots dont have flashing red lights; I know one!
Sorry. You drive. Lets go.
Jonr wedged himself onto a rack, underneath the car and close to the door.
Ishmael put the car into Forward and gritted his teeth while the screeching sound of abrading biomet surfaces increased. It stopped, once the car reached its maximum speed of 5 mph and whispered along the rails, towards the hub. Ishmael stopped the car until two minutes before the Rebel attack. They continued on and had almost reached the hub when Ishmael shouted to Jonr:
Have you ever wondered why Citizens put Conservation first Jonr? Its not as if they keep to it very strictly.
Not now Ish. I am trying to cut my telepath transmissions completely. Dont make me think!
Two SA grunts stopped the car and a Bot with a blue flash, a colonel, strode up to the cars door, motioning for Ishmael to get out. He opened the battered door and climbed down to face the colonel, who began:
Identify yourself. Where have you come from?
Maintenance Bot 3245. Ishmael had read the number on the breast of the maintenance suit. I was despatched from North ramp, sector 2, to carry out routine, daily maintenance checks on the Central Flue Cluster assembly. There! Ishmael pointed but the colonel looked past him and replied:
You have a clone on board.
I have several bodies. They are terminated. We were involved in an attack but Supercity Army soldiers defended us.
Search the car, the colonel ordered two grunts.
There are two dead bodies sir, one of the Bots answered in a mechanical voice.
How long ago were you attacked? the colonel asked Ishmael.
Four minutes and thirty-two seconds ago! Ishmael lied.
It is useful information. I didnt know the Rebels still had forces in the area. But there should not be any Supercity Army force in that area. What squad did the soldiers come fro-?
An incoming telepath message interrupted the colonel and he swung away, just as the sound of laser fire erupted from the west spoke tunnel. His grunts followed him, leaving an opening in the defensive circle of soldiers.
Ishmael sidled towards the door and climbed on board the silver car. He set it in forward motion and tried to stare ahead while hundreds of soldier bots watched his progress. But by the time he parked the car at the base of the flue assembly, the SA fully had engaged with the attacking Rebels and half the force had been sent to reinforce their frontline.
I thought we would never get through! Jonr whispered, climbing out behind the car. Lets go. Using the car to cover their movements, they found a gate in a locked metal cage at the bottom of the tower. Ishmael forced the lock. They reached a set of biomet steps and began to climb.
The steps turned round a central cluster of pipes until it had reached half way to the roof of the vast cavern. From there, only three pipes continued up but were joined by several pipes that came in, at an oblique angle, from the roof, some way out from the cluster. Here, the steps stopped but a ladder led at crazy angles towards where one of those incoming pipes passed through the rock roof. Sometimes the ladder turned on its side as it went up and Jonr felt a less fit man would have fallen off.
By now, the battle raged below them, flashes of laser light and the first explosions from the two Type 45s making the cavern rock glow like crystal. At last, Ishmael reached the opening and scrambled through it. Jonr climbed through after him and found themselves standing on a crudely constructed platform at the base of another ladder; one which ascended vertically.
After you Ishmael, Jonr suggested.
But this could take me back into Supercity. I dont know.
Ill go first then. No time to wait.
Jonr flexed his arms to return blood to their screaming muscles and started up the ladder.
After only about thirty feet, the ladder ended in a trap door. Ishmael swung it up to open it and stepped into a small room, lined with computer monitors. An astonished operator Citizen stood up and stared at Jonr. Jonr swung his laser from his shoulder and took out the operator with one shot. A second later, a door to the room swung open and an even more astonished Armande One, followed by a man in a black suit, entered the room.
***
Armande, dressed in the traditional grey suit of the President, froze in his tracks. Nobody moved. Both parties weighed each other up. Finally, Armande smiled disarmingly and said:
Youre Jonr, the Rebel leader.
How do you know? Jonr replied And who are you?
This is the President, Ishmael felt compelled to explain.
Ah, Armande One, Jonr exclaimed And where are you going with that briefcase Armande?
Perhaps we can come to some arrangement. I just need to climb down that ladder, there, for animportant engagement. Frank needs to come with me. This case contains a lot of valuable information about Supercity; everything a President needs to run it. We could do a swap?
Swap?
You let me pass and you can have the case.
I see. So you are running away. And we havent even entered Supercity yet.
Armande seemed to consider something for a few moments while Frank started to scratch his chest. Armandes henchman seemed completely bored with the situation and then sat on the edge of a desk.
Any second now, soldiers are going to come pouring through that door, Armande said, pointing behind him. You will die instantly. Let me show you what I have here. By the way, see this button; I press it and the case blows up. We all go with it but no more vital information on Supercity and there are no copies. He placed the case on a desk and put his thumbs to sensor pads to unlock it. Opening the case, he swung it towards Jonr.
Ishmael saw the glint of something metallic come out of Franks jacket and then Jonr screamed in pain. Armande leaped for the ladder, followed by Frank. Ishmael had instantly brought his laser to bear on the President but some last piece of respect, programmed into him, stopped him from pulling the trigger. He had no such qualms with Frank and made a mess of the black suit in a fraction of a second. Franks body slid into the wall on the other side of the ladder hatch, just as Armandes head disappeared from view.
Why didnt you shoot? Jonr gasped. After him. Kill him!
Yes.
Ishmael leaped after Armande and started down the ladder. He reached the platform and continued onto the ladder, which took a crazy route towards the pipe cluster. It started to shake with the weight of two androids and Armandes erratic climbing technique.
Jonr stuck his head down through the hatchway and encouraged Ishmael to catch the President. Armande reached a bracket and a section where the ladder turned on its side. He made the mistake of letting go with both hands for a second and lost his balance. With a scream, he fell to his death on the cavern floor below.
Ishmael and Jonr saw a ring of soldiers gather around the smashed android. For a moment, they seemed to be devoid of purpose.
The Supercity Army had moved out to take up advanced defensive positions around the cluster, intended to protect the Presidents escape and only a few grunts remained at the intersection. In the distance could be heard the detonations from the two Type 45s.
Into the void at the centre of the battleground suddenly poured hundreds of Rebels, but from where they came, Ishmael could not tell at first.
Both Ishmael and Jonr looked on as the first one hundred Rebels became a thousand, pouring forth from four hatches at the base of the cluster. Soon the SA became overrun with Rebels and the end looked close.
Somebody tapped Jonr on his shoulder so he turned, expecting a fight.
Kris! he exclaimed.
Hi President!
President?
Looks like it. Our people are all over the city now. Nothing happened. Some of the androids looked alarmed. They shouted, Revolution, but we told them there would be no revolution, only that there would be a new president. They immediately went back to what they had been doing, calmly as ever! Looks like we wont have any trouble from them. A few soldiers manned a Type 45 at the gates to the Government HQ but we went round them and took them out from behind with a grenade. Its all over. So I guess you are now President of Supercity!
Thats fine but I need somebody to look at my other leg. Not sure I will walk for some time.
Cant let you out of my sight for one minute! Kris said, but Jonr had passed out.
***
Leaving
When Jonr woke, he lay in a bed, within Supercitys main hospital. It had taken time to find anything resembling proper surgical instruments, the hospitals own selection consisting of power tools. Somebody had finally found scalpels and other instruments in Supercity Museum.
Ishmael, Mira, Chance and Kris stood over him when he came to.
So how did you get into the city? he asked Kris.
Well, you had been right about the sewers; they did lead into the City, up long flights of stone steps from the two main channels. But you know, the funny thing was that this water vehicle had been tied up on the flushing water of the main sewerdunno what you call such things.
Boats, Ishmael suggested.
Oh, well anyway, I climbed a ladder opposite and saw that it brought us out in the centre of the SA, at that piping cluster you climbed. Once I had organised the attack there, I took the rest of my men to investigate other ways into the city because we couldnt all climb that crazy ladder!
At the top end of the main channel, where we found theboat, we found a long tunnel, cut through solid rock. Some of my men are exploring that now. We think it leads to the spaceship; what they are calling Project Infinity. But we found some proper stairways that led up to the City. That is how we got in! Anyway, we have everything under control now so you just lie here and relax!
Two days later, Jonr could lie still no longer. Supported by crutches, he went to look at the City with his family and Ishmael. When a hovercar had taken them to most of the main sights, Jonr turned to Ishmael and said:
Well, you wanted to show me the Museum. Lets go!
Ishmael showed Jonr and his family the hologram of Arnies skeleton and took them to the vaults to find the M-tag. They found its box, but inside somebody had left a label which read, Removed for renovation. They couldnt find the tag nowhere.
Ishmael led the family back to Arnies display, feeling very disappointed. They watched a holographic display to find out the latest research on Arnies skeleton and Ishmael jumped up and down with joy.
Look! Look! he exclaimed.
The display told how, only days before, archaeologists on Earthone had finally found the proof they needed that Citizens had existed before even hominids. Next to the site where Arnies bones had been dug up, an M-tag had been discovered, the holy grail of archaeology.
Platinum 190, the hologram explained, is so stable that it never corrodes so we knew that one day we would find one. All other parts of Citizens are biodegradable of course, in the name of Conservation. The only thing that could ever remain would be the M-tag. Here it is.
A happy, young, dark-haired archaeologist held up the shiny tag and showed the cam the serial number on the tag; 109987.
It should be noted, the display continued, that M-tag 109987 has been missing from our register since before the time of Supercity and even Marstoo, adding to the evidence that we, the Citizens, came first into the Universe!
Which universe! Jonr exclaimed.
I guess she means Universe A, Ishmael explained. Jonr grinned. Oh, it was a joke!
Live a little! Jonr said. I never hear you tell jokes!
Citizens dont have humour, Ishmael replied. I cant laugh.
***
Jonr arranged for the first open and democratic elections to be held in four years time but for now, the humans had their work cut out, getting Supercity habitable for themselves. The sewers had long since ceased to function and there were few ways to get hot water or a bath. Food didnt seem to be a problem; the hydroponic farms churned out bio-food in all sorts of textures and shapes, just as before. One could easily get roast beef, which had actually been made from vegetable matter, grown using only water and starlight. It tasted just as good as the real thing though.
Increasingly, it became apparent to Jonr that humans did not want to share the city with their former gaolers. He tried to maintain order but when the third riot broke out and two humans were killed by androids who were being disassembled against their will, he had to intervene. He passed a law to have any remaining Bots, except the C-class, put into storage and the C-class banished to the cavern, where they would be given all they needed to build a city of equal magnificence to Supercity. Only one Citizen Family would be allowed to remain in Supercity.
As soon as the battle had died down, Ishmaels heart had dragged him away to search for Yaela. He couldnt find her in her house and after questioning her neighbours, he found out that she had become pregnant. Bemused, he headed for the main hospital and found her in a ward near Jonrs.
Darling! You are alive! she exclaimed, seeing his battered face. She noted his limp. What happened to your leg?
Ishmael showed her the Supsercity Army leg.
Not very fashionable but I dont mind! she said.
You heard what happened?
Yes. The news bulletins were full of it yesterday. I couldnt believe they were talking about you. But my loyalty rating is nearly one hundred Ismael. I could never stop loving you, and look! She held up the bundle that had been sleeping in her arms; a new baby girl. I dont know what to call her. I wanted to wait until you could help me choose.
How about Serendipity?
Its a bit long.
It can be shortened to Chancy.
Really? Okay then.
But how? Yaela. My Personality chip says I will have no offspring!
I dont know Ishmael. It must have been that last night you visited me. Something must have happened. Some of the new human nurses are saying you are conscious. What does that mean?
I will explain later. 
As soon as Jonr was able to get around the hotel on his crutches, Ishmael introduced him to Yaela and the new-born Chancy. Jonr smiled and made all the right noises but he looked awkward. As soon they were out of Yaelas earshot, Jonr pulled Ishmael aside, whispering:
But how is it possible? I have never understand what happens with android birth. Did she actually give birth?
Ah. Its complicated but basically, yes, Yaelas body is capable of manufacturing a tinyandroid. This android has no M-tag and is not really aware of anything. It doesnt grow but after six months, it is taken away and replaced by a minor, which has the new M-tag. I only learned all this yesterday in the Hospital archives because I thought I ought to swat-up; I think thats the phrase. This information is not normally known to Citizens and these stages are masked by memory blackouts. There are five more minor stages, times when the chip is passed to a bigger minor, all held in storage and used over and over again of course, until the minor becomes an adult.
I see. Amazing!
But you know Ishmael, there is unrest in the City. I am not sure how long humans and androids can live together. Something needs to be done.
***
By a unanimous vote, the new inhabitants of Supercity decided that Ishmael and his family would be allowed to stay in the City. 
Armande had been prepared to launch the spaceship Infinity immediately with only the specially modified C-class Bots to accompany him; his excuse; that they needed an administrator Bot to control them. He never even considered taking the extra twenty humans, for which Infinity had been designed.
Jonr proceeded with plans to launch the ship, using the twenty modified Bots and twenty human volunteers. He invited Ishmael to join the crew but the ex-Citizen dropped a bombshell:
I have only six months left to live Jonr. I will be naturally Terminated and there is nothing that can be done to stop that!
Six months? It is too short!
But I am one thousand years old. And now I have a child. I am not sad at all!
We will delay launch for six months then. Besides, I am told it might take that long for the Earthone computer to calculate the possible point of collapse and the location of the Blinker star. Its never in the same place as the Big Bang!
You believe the theory then? But the collapsing balloon; you can never reach the void from the surface.
The analogy is imperfect. The surface metaphor is approximate, to say the least.
I wish you all the best of luck then. I wish I could come. Perhaps you could take Chancy?
I will think about it.
Jonr. There is one last thing I want to do together. Your Chance once told me that Supercity is underground. But I remember seeing passenger rockets heading to Earthone. Every day, it seemed one would pass overheard. I need to see for myself.
Very well. Up there, you will find only the hydroponic farms. But lets go and see.
By means of a well-hidden elevator system, they ascended for three quarters or a mile before the elevator passed a flat surface, painted to represent sky. Ishmael stared at it in disbelief. Above it lay only a complex framework of ancient seribdenum and biomet beams, which supported a vast hydroponic farm. Above this, he could see a vast set of transparent panels, much as above the Cavern, and through these panels he could see the main star of Marstoo.
I see it, and now I finally believe it, Ishmael said. It makes me feel sad. But at least I am seeing reality.
One reality, Jonr corrected. Our reality, but there may be others!
Yes. Lets go back. I have seen enough.
But Ishmaels plans for little Chance were not to be realised.
Three months later, a man broke into Ishmaels house and killed Chance as she played with her toys. Yaela had been ironing and suffered severe damage, trying to protect her child.
***
Infinity had the most probably location of the Blinker star programmed in and the twenty special Bots had been prepared. Twenty human volunteers, including Jonr and his family, had been chosen and the adventure seemed about to begin when tragedy struck again.
During a short shopping trip, a man attacked the repaired Yaela with a laser and destroyed her.
Ishmael had been beside himself with grief. He told Jonr that he yearned for his own Termination now. Jonr had the android taken into protection until that time came.
On the eve of Infinitys launch, Ishmael lay on his deathbed, waiting for all his system to shut down. Already, he could no longer feel his legs. Jonr broke off all engagements to sit with his friend until the end. He tried to say something cheerful:
I have some news. You know those Ischians who we once fought so bitterly?
Ah yes, the Dogs. I remember.
Guess what; some of them survived their war with the Timpoids after all. They have contacted us. They have their own calculations for finding the Blinker and want to come with us!
Will you let them?
Well, they cant have survived this long without becoming peaceful. Ten of them arrive today.
Good. The more the merrier, I think you humans say; I found that in the annals!
Jonr reached out and took his friends hand.
Jonr, I dont think I have more than a few minutes left. There is something I want you to do for me.
Yes?
When the lights go out in my eyes, I want you to turn me over. On my back, you will find a panel, marked C199989. You will need a special tool; its there, on the table. Take the panel off and look deep inside the cavity. At the very back, you will see a small silver plate. Its the M-tag. I want you to take it out and look at it.
When we were in the Museum and saw that M-tag holo-image, it occurred to me that a Makers Tag would not only contain the serial number but some emblem of the Maker; or at least that seems to be what humans do. I have never seen the reverse side of a tag; they never show it. I want you to look. If I am right, it might prove, once and for all, who created me; an android or a human.
Youre still not convinced?
I am but we need proof; I dont want those C-classbeings on the Infinity believing a lie. Unfortunately, I wont be here to see the proof.
But I could take it out now!
No! No, dont do that. It forms a vital part of my circuits; without it, I cant function and I want to experience my last minutes with you. Tell me what your thoughts about my baby, Chancy.
Well, I didnt have much time with her, but she seemed as beautiful as any child of my own could be. My Chance loved her, of course. Jonr glanced at Ishmael but the light in his eyes had gone out.
Jonr turned over the android and used the tool to release the service plate. Deep inside, he saw the platinum 190 tag and removed it. He saw the serial number C199989 and turned the tag over. He knew the archaeologists on Earthone hadnt falsified the discovery of the M-tag in the same geological layer as the 5.4 million years BC hominid, Arnie, so what he saw took his breath away. He saw the unmistakable, etched image of a human family; a father with his arm around a mother and a child, who waggled two fingers behind his fathers head, mimicking the ears of a rabbit or some other big-eared mammal.
 That settles that then, whispered Jonr. Humans must have created the C-class. But if there were intelligent humans before Arnie, where did they come from?

Epilogue

The Infinitys engines had been limited to Impulse power for three weeks but now she had safely left the orbit of Marstoos sun. The crew had settled in and even the Ischians seemed to mix in well. Morale rose high and anticipation of adventure even higher.
Jonr sat in the Captains Chair and surveyed all the system lights for the half-mile diameter spaceship, which had taken a thousand years to build. All lights were green. The time to go had come.
Travelling at 0.6 times the speed of light and using a worm hole every day, each of approximately 4 million light years in distance, which the sophisticated on board systems had finally been able to locate, they could reach the Blinker star in less ten years. That would be just before the Blinker went out and the Big Crunch annihilated everything in Universe A.
Jonr cleared his throat and ordered, Engage full power, now!
