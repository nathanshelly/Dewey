Hard love

1

Henrietta Kovcs was wakefully turning in her bed, on a warm summer evening, after eleven. But it wasnt the warmth that retained from sleeping. However the teenage girl went to sleep already at ten oclock, the usual thing was that didnt let her sleep. She was convulsively hanging on the blanket from the grief and pressed close to the wall. If only she could hanging on her loved man and could press close to him! She was breathing sobbing from the grief but didnt come out any tears from her eyes. However the girl was already eighteen, she was still hopelessly in love with a Black, American actor who was twenty-nine older then her and who had a wife for five and a half years. The man lived in friendship with her after their marriage, and they already a children since last year. Heni tried to quash in her that feeling that she thought it was wicked, that she hoped that Gina Torres will have a miscarriage, to the baby dont set together more with Laurence Fishburne. Not like she had much more hope for this impossible love
She woke up for a sunlit morning in her small room. As usually, she brushed her fairish brown hair, took two barrettes into it, penciled her eyebrow and the bottom of her brown eyes, rouged her thin lips and put some lip shine on it in the beautiful bathroom, whats washstand were on three snow-white cupboards. There were more two cupboards newt to them, and two drawers over them. A roundish, golden lug paraded on every cupboard and drawers. The colour of the cupboards upside was light white and grey in speckles. Heni liked this bathroom and liked that they were that beautiful flat. But she know that she wanted Laurence too if he wasnt much richer than they were, and if he suddeny became a homeless. Heni and her family wasnt rich, they just maybe were in better material status than average. They didnt use to spend their money for tours, but for them flat. If they spended it the more to travelling, how Heni could go to New York to be nearer to his much loved man and to get know that place where the man she loved was living! She also planned that if she had enough money for that, so she reached to the city, any time and striving was it, she searched that house where Laurence lived.  Surely something tall fence what she had to searce. And if that shy girls had some spirit for it, she rang all of the houses what had tall fence, she asked whos house is it, and if she got know that Laurence lives there, she went a lot of times in front of his house like she went to somewhere other place. The man perhaps could notice her sometimes and she could make a friendship with him, and if he divorced from his wife because of something, she may be the next one But there werent much hope for that, tha actor surely had a lot of, much more fans. But they isnt that unrelenting and they dont porpose plans like that. Is it possible it works?
When Heni finished the apllying, she cleared up in her room and made up her bed. In the room there were a row of dark brown wardrobes and cases and a dask next to them, with a hi-fi equipment on it. In front of the wardrobes and cases, there was her bed with an orange cover and jonquil pattern on it, and there was a jonquil cod pillow leaned its red, arched board. The carpet was orange colored and big flower heads ornated its verge.
After she finished in her room, she weighted out her breakfast  how her diet prescribed it, and she ate it in front of the TV. She was on a diet for a long time, but she was 55 kilos with 160 centimetres. But she already didnt dare to experiment with more diets, she only trused her nutritionist who she went  this is much more personal so more efficient way. People could complain whenever if she gave something wrong advice and it was tailor-made, so it gived a surer way. This uninterrupted experimentation with diets have endured for five years. She have more and more liked Laurence more long time, for six years. I love his look, his voice, his move, and his personality too  she said, and she very felt like this. Withal that she have twenty movies with his cast and she have sixteen of them at home, she knew know the actors life by heart too. Among others she knew know that he used drugs for some time, but he turned out to break out from this, and if someone want to knock off, he or she has to suffer terrible torments, and he or she need huge self-control to dont give himself or herself another dose what would water down his or her sufferings because hes or hes only going to knock off if he or she doesent water off them another dose, but he or she wait to that the distractiion symptoms are going to expire self-moving, after much more time, but at least forever. In addition, Laurence undertook a third child when he was fourty-five years old  however, the first children were from his previous wife -, that means that children were also important to him, not only the stardom.
After breakfast, Heni turned on her computer, did her usual, everyday thigs on it: among others she looked after her most watched channels that programmes where maybe going to be a movie what interests her, because of the movie or because Laurences cast. In addition, she ran an own profile on a partner-searcher on the internet, maybe she will find a boy who she would like, to get some experiences and confidence in herself in the course of the relationship, how she has done it with two boys till now. This boys knew that Heni didnt feel love about them, but they were with her  one of them for a year, the other for three weeks. She got acquainted them on the internet, becaouse Heni were a very shy girl: she only said hello and answered to everybody, without her family, her best friend and some of her kindreds, and without the important things. Her relationship whit her first boyfriend was also important to her, so she talked at least with him a bit more, to dont lose him.
Heni chatted on the net every day, to find there more friends, because her class mates didnt treat of her, only when they rallied her, because of her shyness. In addition, she also would be more happy if she found on the chat a third boy who she would like, to be with him, but most of them are primitive and light-minded  how Heni pened it.
Heni practised Engilsh language on every summer, fall, spring and winter school holiday with a test what was a part of a dictionary on her computer. In schooltime, she studied after school that words too what she heard at school and that wasnt obligatory to study. Of course, because the Hungarian girl had to understand more words with her Engliesh-languaged love, if that one will come true from some billions that they will be together.
After she turned off the computer, she read the Bible for half an hour how she did it every day on summer holidays. She did it because her mother was a Jehovas Witness, so Heni got acquainted with this religion, with its rules and habits, and that this religion is much logical and much more believable than every other religions  how she said it. She studied Bible every week with her mother, from another, more understandable penned book, but she still read Bible to got know that are there everything in that how  she learned it from Jehovas Witnesss point of view. She wanted to get a bigger faith from this, or at least to procure that she could tell irreligious people that she already read over the Bible personally, she dont only unseeingly believe Jehovas Witnesses.
After Heni finished reading the book for half an hour, she did some housework for half an hour she did it every day since she were eighteen, for three months. She felt this were her duty: I live there only because I havent marry anybody, so I just live off others  she said, and she felt like it. She never use to lied and tryed to dont contravene any rules of her religion. She tryed to forget a lot of time the married man who she loved, but it didnt work, and at the end she realized that Bible was written when much-loved, occupied persons got know that if a wicked, who was in love with her or him, were looking at him or her, so he or she maybe could seduce her or him. But now there was television, cinema, DVD and internet, what through the loved person didnt got know about his or her fan, so its possible to seduce him or her from her consort.
After housework, Heni had her lunch in front of the TV, then did her practicing of the half an hour company dance. She has went to company dance course since she were seventeen years old, and she did it for Laurence too: to get part of a bigger race where she would doing something what people usually dont do there, but what isnt vicious. Something what people would wright about in magazines or newspapers and internet and talking about in TV on the other side of the Earth too, to Laurence get know her. But Heni realized that her talent is the least of all in everything in the world. So she was the most wooden on neophytes course too, and after she practiced dancing during the break of the middle courses pause time for summer holiday, the teacher brought her down without she would look at if Heni progressed since then. She refered her immediately in the middle course, so she did this course two times. But Heni couldnt sustain satbacks without that she would finde something good in that, only in very-very unremarkable things. So she took it into her had that maybe she will more skillful than the others because of this misunderstanding, and because of the man she loved.
Heni had her breakfast in front of the TV, than did her gymnastics for what also took half an hour. So the girl had two hours of duties every day on summer holiday, she didnt use to housework only when she slept at other ones house, because it wasnt her duty and they didnt require it from her there.
After gymnastic, she was reading the current love novel what book she read now, but she have read these books for years.
- Heni, I will took in The Matrix 2, are you watching it?  her beautiful, thin younger sister, Eliza with long blond hair and green, villain cat-eyes opened in Henis room.
- Yeah  Heni said, than read over the paige, closed the book and scrupulously took it back between the other books, than went out to the living-room and sat down to the sofa  Eliza, watch it with me or I wont watch it! Ive said that I only dare to watch Laurences movies when somebody watch it with me bacause otherwise I miss him more - repined because her fifteen years old sister was playing with their puppy, Kabos. However Heni watched this move because athe man she loved, she liked when something keeps her busy from Laurence, she was interested in others reaction to the movie, mainly when she or he havent seen it already. However, each of them have seen a lot of times this move so it didnt work now. Heni was sitting in front of the screen bored and with pudding-face, and when Laurence appeared in the movie, that sweet feeling transported her what usually did, she felt her heartbeat without she took her hand on her chest. Then the agonized, grievous lack feeling replaced that beautiful feeling. Im goint to be succeed to get him, or Im going to forget him  said to herself ther usual reassuring sentence, what she made feel her a bit better, for a while.
- Eliza, what have been your best day?  asked suddenly, during the move.
- How could I know it? I wont considering on it now! Why, what have been yours?
- Mine ones were when whe saw in cinema The Matrix 2, Tha Matrix 3 and Mission Impossible 3  her face flashed from these reminiscences.
- Ouch, I would could think about this! You should already forget this monkey! You should grow up from this silliness!
- I know - she got sad again and felt her love awkward like a lot of times.
- Im already bored with this movie I will continue this puzzle  Eliza began to speak later.
- I dont understand whats the use of finish so many puzzle. You anyway already can do everything, why do you have to evindence it with this woo?  her older sister envied.
- I dont can do everything! Do you know how much I want to do the splits?!
- Oh, lest you die of this! In turn, I cant do anything in any level.
- I dont believe it, just you give up everything too early.
- Everybody tell me this because they havent seen me doing everything. Anyway, most people tell me Im very stayer.
- OK, but they tell it about your dieting, and its not that thing what Im talking about now.
- And Im the most stayer in love too.
- Ouch!  Eliza said bitingly. Now there you go! This talking at last kept her busy from Laurence, then they talked about that again. Aside from, Heni was who talked about it again! She took out their guineapig from the cage and she was fondling it during the movie. She also bored the movie already.

- Hi, Im Heni.
- Hi.
- Can you come round today?
- Is it OK between three and four?
- Good. Hi.
- Hi  the usual phone call took place one days ago, on the afternoon, between Edig and Tamara, who was her and Elizas best friend. Theyve been friends already since they used to go to kindergarten. Heni scrupulously took back her phone into its case and walked back into Elizas room to continue painting. Who other could she paint than Laurence, from one of his photo what she got from the internet how she usually did. 
After hours, when she finished painting, rang the bell. Heni let in the tall, thin, high-bronzed, seventeen-year-old girl who had half-length, dark brown hair and brown eyes.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- By bike is below as usually  the usual talking rung at the door, than Heni went down with Tamara to take the bicycle into the holding as usually. After they came back, they went into Elizas big, messy room with her, how they usually did.
- What will we doing?  Heni asked the question, how at every turn.
- I-1m voting for the buttle-whirling game, for the plying game, for the Activity, for the drawing-talking and for the What would be if  Tamara answered.
- Eliza?  Heni turned towards her sister.
- I dont know. For example, drawing-talking, Activity and buttle-whirling game  Eliza answered idly.
- Im voting for the buttle-whirling game, for the plying game, for the drawing-talking, for the Laurence plarlour game and for the Trivial Pursuit. So I will select it by a draw  Heni ran into her room, groovy took down a plarlour game from the wardrobe, took it to her desk, took a dice out of it, than went back to the others  If it will be even, then it will be the buttle-whirling game, and if it will be odd, than it will be the drawing-talking  she dropped dice. It was even. They began the buttle-whirling game.
- Who will that one who towards the buttle will stop, she will decide what will we do when we finish this game  Heni said, and the buttle stopped at her.
- Fluker!  Eliza fumed.
- OK. It will be the Laurence plarlour game, anyway we play it the most rarely.
- Ouch!  her younger sister moaned. After the game ended, Heni scurried into her room and took out from there the plarlour game she made. On the points, Laurence were smiling or looked seriously, or was pointed one or six with one of his muscular arm. At the smiling, that one could get scores who answered a question rightly about the actor, at the serious one, that one could lose one score if she answered wrongly and could get one if she answered rightly. Everybody had to hoard twelve wright scores to start to the target, only Heni had to hoard twice as much: twenty-four, because she knew the questions and the right answeres by heart, and she knew them in every occasion. She read to the questions. When the hand pointed one, meaned that the gamer can only go onwards if she drop one, and when it pointed six, it was the some, only with six dropping. When Laurence used that beckoning symbol on the point how he did it in The Matrix, the gamer could drop again. When there was the phoning Laurence, coppied from the back of the Mission Impossible DVDs sheating, the gamer could ask for one help to answer the one question. When there were one of the actors enticing eye on the point, the gamer could look at the right answer, and get the score. When the spot illustrated a fish, they played with the What would if plarlour games question cards for a question, and these ones got a score who answered the same as other gamer. The questions always refered to Laurence. Sometimes she felt that plarlour game childis or crazy but she loved to treast with Laurence. Heni nha gyerekesnek vagy rltsgnek rezte ezt a jtkot, de imdott Laurence-szel foglalkozni.
	After playing with the plarlour game, the girls played plying game, then they were drawing. Heni was drawing Laurence like a lot of times.
- Szanra, why didnt tell about your love that it more hopeless than mine?  Heni asked during it.
- Have I told that?  Tamara wondered.
- Yeah, when you have mentioned for the first time that you are in love.
- I dont remember yet, Im Forgetter.
- How many times have you dreamed about your love?
- I dont know it already, a lot of times. You more times, a think.
- I think that too
- Im already setting now.
- Why have to go?  Heni asked disappointedly. She felt these friendly habits childish what they usually did together but she liked spend her time with her friend.
- Already passed six oclock.
- And what do you have to do?  Heni took the old slippers from the brown plastic shoes case what was under the mirrors, in the hall, and she took it up.
- Im reading my required reading, than The safe is starting  Heni went down with Szanra to open the holdings door  Hi.
- Hi  after then, Heni closed the stairwells door. She climbed back to the second foor, and continued the drawing. When she finished it, brought down Kabos, then weighed aout her dinner and ate it in front of the TV.
- Heni, change please! This clothes isnt to at home  her mother beguan to speak.
- Its interesting, I still havent seen anywhere that people would change after they came home from somewhere.
- But everybody changes. You know what Im wearing now too.
	After Heni ate her dinner, she changed, then she was reading.
- Hi Pussycat  her fathers voice took place into the room.
- Hello  his wife said. The husband took his laptop out from his bag, sat down to the living-rooms table and turned it on.
- My parents won on the lottery.
- Dont make me crazy! And how many did they win?
- Twenty million. There giving five million for me, bel and Benjmin, and theyre divving the rest between the kindreds. Heni just finished with the paige and ran into the living-room through the hallway.
- And what are we goint to do to this money?  asked immediately when she arrived there.
- I dont know, I think we could buy a bigger TV at first, then well see it  her father answered.
- Yeah, Anrs, we already need a bigger TV there, this small one doesent befit there  her mother agreed.
- Are we going to go to America  Henis heart were wildly beating from the excitement.

- Eliza, arent you afraid?  Heni cowered uptightly on the planes seat.
- Ouch, Heni, you know that cars are much more dangerous than aeroplanes  her sister said flipperty-flopperty.
- I know but we dont surely die of in a car accident, but surely in a plane accident. I more would like to surely have a car accident if I wont die than maybe crach and surely die.
- You wanted the most to go to America.
- Yes, but it would be better if it would be possible to go there by car too.
- Thats a thing.
- Oh my God, were lifting!
- Ouch, Heni, It seems that you havent travelled by plane yet!
- Why, you havent too!  Heni holded on to her seat.
	The plane succesfully arrived to New York. The sun was shining there too when passengers left the plane. The family went onwards to the hotel by bus. While they was going to the coach-station, was waiting for the bus, and on the bus, Heni felt it awkward but she realized that she always was looking for that does she notice somewhere the man she loved. Also after they left the bus and went onwards on foot to the hotel. The huge, tall building even didnt replace thinking about him, but the other members of the family were looked at them wondering.
	Their hotel room was beautiful  they had so much money to go to Amerika so they didnt begrudge the money for the room. Heni happily went to her room and took her clothes in the snow-white wardrobe what had golden lugs. This was like the cupboards at home, in the bathroom but it looked better in the bedroom. There was a light brown dressing table next to it, with golden lugs on its cases and shelves too and with a pink-pollowed, rotud-upsided chair without backboard. In front of them, therve were the single bed with light blue cover and pollow, and the carpet was flaming red.
	Heni put her clothes into the wardrobe and her diary into one of the dressing tables upper shelf after she wrote it, then went to sleep how the other members of the family. She hardly fell asleep when it came into her head that she still had more hope than one of some billon, to be a couple with Laurence. She was breathing hardly and was feeling physical pain in her heart.
	The following day, after a long selecging, Heni took up her white, flower-patterned top what covered only her breasts and her long, pink, with waves on its depth and her white, golden patterned sandal with tall heels. These looked beautifully together. Heni wanted to good first impress on Laurence for that possibility that the one from some billion will happen that she will see him on the street. She needed it for than, when he will divorce from Gina, to Laurence make allowence for Heni too. But she felt terribly childish because of this unreasoning thinking. He still didnt know that she is on the world! But at least she knew that she did everything.
- Henike, are you ready yet?  her mothers voice sounded from the hall.
- Heni, you was one who wanted to start early to sightseeing  her her father called too. Heni stepped out from her room in that trice and set with the others.
- Its such an incredible that there are only that tall buildings like these  her mother began to speak after an hour of walking.
- Cant we go there where are interesting things too?  Eliza repined. Heni just beholded a tall fence in that trice. She stopped, caring for the others who didnt even notice that she dropped behind. Otherwise, she had mobile so she could call them and tell where she is. This were that trice that she have thought of so many times.
She was standing there for minutes, trying strenghten to ring. She rang with trepidant hand, and a tall, muscular man opened door. Surely he was the stars bodyguard.
- Who are you the question sounded in English.
- Whos flat is this?  Heni asked with trepidant voice, accordingly her learning English her eight years.
- Who do you looking for?  what a practical question! Heni didnt even get ready for this. 
Surely somebody big star lives here because his or her bodyguard dont even tell her that he or she lives her  she thought - So not Luarence. Or they shield every star so much? Or is Laurence also a big star in this country?
- I just would like to know that where lives Laurence Fishburne. This is the reason of that I ring in every tall fenced house because maybe somebody who open the door, tell me that who lives there  Heni confessed flounder, because didnt come every English word into her mind immediately because of the turmoil.
- OK. Tom Cruise and his family live here. Goodbye  then the bodyguard slammed the gate.
Tom Cruise is Laurences friend since their childhood! So Laurence cant live far!  came to Henis mind, so set onwards to searching for more houses with a tall fence. She did it at more five houses, and she got to it more and more. At some house a housekeeper opened door, and answered immediately that who lived there. She was at one of Brad Pitts, Jennyfer Lopezs, Shannen Dohertys, Lindsay Lohans and Rachel McAdamss house too! It would be more exciting if she saw more from the houses of the stars than the tall fence and the bodyguard or housekeeper.
She have walking so much that her sola was already paining. During it, when her mother called her, she told that she didnt need them to go there, she still wanted to take in there where she were.
Four hours passed away, while she succeed to be sure about more five houses that it wasnt Laurence who lived there. She had to have lunch now because of her diet, so she called her father and told the name of the street to go there to bring her back to the hotel. The family had lunch at the hotels restaurant, Heni in the living-room because she had to weight out the lunch. Then she was on the internet on her fathers laptop.
Later, she searched for the bus schedule in her parents room, searched from it the street where she searched for the houses with tall fence, looked for what bus goes to there from that street when the hotel were and how many bus stations she had to go.
- Im going to sightseeing  said after the other members of the family came back from the restaurant, didnt wait for their answere, and set. The whole family got some money from Jakab, Heni also had that much on her whats enough for the bus.
	She found the nearest coach-station in a half an hour but the bus arrived in some minutes. The journey took twenty miutes as when her father brought her back to the hotel.
	She was counting the bus stations, and after she left the bus, set to a deals she choosed unintentionally, and began searching for the houses with tall fence. An hour later she found one, she did what at the others. This was one of Britney Spearss house. Then she went back to the hotel because she had to eat her snack. She didnt dare to go back again, it would be too suspicious to the family, and she didnt want them to know what a childish bullcrap was she doing.
	The family was reposing at the hotel till dinner. Eliza was reading one of her adventure novel in her room, Jakab was wathcing TV in the living-room, maybe his command of English language is enough to enjoy the programme, her wife was studying a Watchtower in their room, Heni was speding her time with reading Bible for half an hour, in her own room. After she done, she did her dance practicing for an half an hour. She didnt have to do any housework because she were a guest with her family, and her half an hour moving was more than enough with that walking for hours, so she spended her free time with reading.
- Whe could go somewhere more, couldnt we, Ducky?  Jakab asked during having dinner.
- Where do you want to go?  her wife asked back.
- I think we could look at the patisseries what like are theese here.
	The family went to the patisserie, while Heni was taking hereabout with two dumpling of ice-cream in her hand. She couldnt eat other sweets because of her diet. She noticed one more house with a tall fence. She thought to ring at that too, to trying with other house like that. She asked her usual quastions, but her head was spinning from the answer. Its Laurences house!
- Id dont want to Laurence and his family got know that I looked for them  said to the housekeeper after she steeled herself a bit.
- And why did you look for them?  Oh my Got, what to answer to that?  Heni frightened, thinking to herself.
- Im Laurences fan and I wanted to see where does he live.
- I understand it. So I wont tell it. Goodbye  the woman closed the gate.
	Heni went back in front of the patisseries door where she was waiting for her family to come, to go back to the hotel, to write in her diary what happened.

	Next day, in the morning, Heni got at it hard to brushing her hair and to puting up makeup, then took up her long, red top with hanging it to her neck and her long, red skirt with wavy depth,with her usually, white sandal with golden pattern on it, and her white shoulder bag.
- I will take in there more when we were yesterday evening!  everybody shouted after breajfadt from the hall and she didnt wait for the answer, just left.
She was wondering what like place is that where the man she loved lived, and, of course, she had to walking there his houses neighborhood, to Laurence notice her, and maybe, one day to talk to him. There were smaller squares, they looked older than New Yorks other places where she have been, and there was much less people on the street and highway and beautiful green trees, shrubs and grass.
She was taking in the street for a hour, then she already couldnt to do anything so went back to the hotel.
- Well, what were on that place, Henike?  her mother asked when her daughter arrived. She told what was it like  And how did you finde there?
- I looked for in the bus schedule what bus I shoulded go with and after how many bus stations I had to live the bus.
- Its interesting, here, in New York, you go out a lot of, but, at home, youre in the flat all day. I knew that this city interests you but I didnt know that so much.
- I was looking forward to come here for years. Why wouldnt it interest me?  then Heni went into her room to read Bible.
- Well, where are we goint today?  Jakab asked the family in the living-room when Heni was already reading there the love novel, sitting on the unicoloured dark blue sofa, in front of the TV what was turnded off. That was the reason of Heni came out from her room, because the telly wasnt bothering her in reading. There were two unicoloured dark blue armchairs on the sofas two sides and there were a unicoloured light blue carpet in the middle of the floor. The TV standed on a light brown, tree case.
- Well, I dont know where could we go more  his wife answered.
- Im going to look at the coons in the dumpsters  Eliza said, standed up from the armchair, put on her book and set to thel hall, to take on her shoes.
- Why could be any coons in the dumpsters?  Heni asked.
- People got nature from them and they can conformity in big cities too.
- And how do you know it?
- I have knew it for a long time.
- Im going too  Heni also took up her sandal and left with her sister.
- There is a dumpster  Are we looking at it?  Eliza called.
- Maybe people think were homelesses  Heni laughed.
- No, it seems on our clothes. But lets waiting for till the traffic will be less. 
- In New York?!
- Thats true. So are we going?
- Lets go!  Heni laughed.
- Whats up?
- It came into my head what if Laurence would see me now at the first time!
- Ouch, Heni, how many chances is there for that?!  they arrived to the dumpster. Eliza opened up its uspide  There is one! So cute!  her sister called.
- What do you think does it bite?
- How wouldnt it bite?! People nor tame their in zoo!
- Thats true.
	They looked for by curiosity that in how many more dumpsteres will they finde a coon. They found one more in one of these, then they went back to the hotel.
- Well, did you finde any coons?  their mother asked them while Heni was taking off her sandal, Eliza her shoes.
- Yeah, in two dumpsteres too! Theyre so cute! Dont you look at them?  Eliza asked.
- Of course, wi will be dubstining under the public eye!  her mother disagreed.
- Ouch, Pussycat, you dam everything to yourself!  Jakab had the foor.
- Dad, will you look at it?  Heni asked.
- Im not interested in this so much but Mom could be look at this if she would like it. Well, its the same, forget about it. Where are we going to today?
- I think let look at that parts of the city where we havent been  his wife suggested.
- When will we go?  Heni asked to know how to do her usual things.
- Well, I think we can go right now. Are you ready?
- Im ready  Heni said.
- Me too  Eliza answered too.
- Pussycat?
- For aught I care, we can go.
	They waited in the coach-station for twenty minutes, and the journey was fourty minutes.
- I just thought whe could go up to a buildings top floor  Jakab began to speak.
- Im going!  Eliza said.
- Me too!  Heni said  I havent been yet in a building what was taller than ten floors.
- And now did we travel there by bus for this? their mother was abashed.
- I thought there will be here something, but I see there are the same things that we already have seen. Anyway, we havent been in that tall building like this  Jakab answered.
- So lets go  his wife agreed. They set towards the building.
- Are we going by elevator?  asked Heni.
- Why, could you climb so many stairs?  her father asked back.
- I dont know, I surely got tired if I can climb it at all. But everybody else too, dont they?
- Well, they surely would be tired from that much  her mother said, then they went through the buildings door and Jakab called the elevator.
- And are we going to go to the top floor?  Heni asked uptightly.
- Yeah  Jakab answered, and the family went in the elevator.
- How many storied is this building?  Heni became more and more wrought-up.
- Fifty-sixty? How could I know it? I didnt counted it.
- Oh my God!
- Heni, we have gone to the Eiffel-tower too!  Eliza began to speak too.
- Thats true. What one is taller?  Heni asked.
- Well, Eiffel-tower is much taller than this  Jakab answered.
- So we have been in a taller building too  Heni said.
- Yeah, but its other thing to go up to a tower and other thing to look down where people already got to live there  then the family got out of the elevator.
- Ooh! People look down from there every day?  Eliza went to the window of the stairway.
- So I am  Jakab said.
- Is scary  Heni contributed after she looked down at the window.
- Its odd how people can get to that  already her mother was standing at the winow too  I will take a picture about you at the window  she got out the camera and took a picture about them  Jakab, take one about me too!  he also took a picture about them, then they went back to the hotel by bus. 
Jakab was working on his laptop, sitting on the living rooms sofa, her wife was study the Watch Tower in their bedroom, Heni was reading Bible, after snack, she practiced the dance, and at half past four, she was reading a novel during gymnasctics. Eliza was reading her adventure novel.
- Are we going to somewhere more today? -  Jakab asked while he was still siggint on the sofa and Heni was practicing the dance in the living-room after dinner. There wasnt enough space for that on other places. Eliza was lying on one of the airmchairs, her mother was sitting on the sofa, next to her husbond, and they were looking at the practicing by boredam.
- Jakab, I think there isnt many places to go here. We go to a lot of places every day, and there doesent rest anything for the other days.
- Maybe youre right. I just thinked about we didnt come here to be in the hotel but to take in.
- Thats right. Children, where do you would like to go?
- There are a lot of places in the city where we havent been, arent there?  Heni asked.
- We already have been a lot of places, the city looks the same everywhere. So should we wast money to travel to many places in the city, just because we came here?  Eliza had the floor.
- Maybe the city isnt the same everywhere  Heni said.
- I think we could go to a museum, to a showing what there isnt in Hungary. What do you say? Jakab asked.
- Ok, we can go there  her wife agreed.
- Ok, lets go  Heni also said.
- And what like museum are we going? At least lets look at that one what interests us!  Eliza always liked to sting about money.
- Il look for right what like museums are there in New York -  Jakab said - I finded one  he beguan to speak after some minutes. The family went to the museum.

- Did you like the museum?  Jakab asked at ten oclock in the evening, while he was sitting on the sofa. The telly was turned on and the family was watching it by boredom, however, Heni and Eliza werent udnerstand a lot about from the English speaking, and her mother didnt use to understand nothing. Heni was writing her diary while sitting on the armchair, Eliza was sitting on the other one, and their mother was sitting next to her husband, on the sofa.
- It was good  her wife said.
- It was interesting, I havent seen anything like that yet  Heni contributed.
- Timcsi?  Adrs asked.
- I think that too  Eliza answered impassively.

The family spended the next morning in the hotel. Edit was practicing dancing in the living-room then reading the Bible in her room, Eliza was reading her adventure novel in her room, Jakab was working in the living-room on his laptop, and his wife was studiing Watch Towel in their room.
- I just thought we could go to have lunch in a restaurant here. We could try what a traditional restaurant like here  Jakab looked at her wife, then at Edit, then at Eliza, when they all were in the living-room.
- We can go  her wife said.
- Lets go  Eliza said.
- I wont go because it would look crazy their if I weighed the luch out.
	After the other members of the family went to the restaurant, Edit had lunch, then used the internet, then an idea came into her head. Jakab said it takes fourty-five minutes to travel to the restaurant. They arrived there about now, and it will take two hours till theyre going to have lunch because surely a lot of people in the restaurant, and they have to wait till theyre goint to got the lunch, then theyre going to arrive back in fourty-five minutes. So she had two hours and fourty-five minutes yet. She looked in the bus schedule when the next bus  is going to come, what  is going to take her there were Laurence lived. She  is going to arrive there in the bus station in fifteen minutes, and the bus  is going to take her there in twenty minutes. She looked after how much money she had in her bag. It was enough for shopping. So she  is going to arrive there thirty-five minutes later, she is going to start back after a half an hour, when the bus  is going to come back and it is going to take her back in twenty minutes, and she is going to arrive back to the hotel in abundence before the family is going to arrive, and they arent going to know about anything.
	She set to the bus station and the bus arrived after two minutes. After she left the bus, she walked in front of Laurences house with her feminine Grace how she usually walked, then went into the nearest store for shopping, then walked again in front of the house of the man she loved. After a half an hour, she went back to the hotel by bus.
	In the hotel, she continued to use internet, and after familys other members came back, she was gymnasticsing during reading at half past five, then watching TV with the family, then continued to reading.

- Are we going somewhere today  Jakab asked next day, before some minutes at half past three in the afternoon, sitting on the sofa of the living-room, in front of his laptop.
- We walk so much since we are here, I think lets have some days when were havint a rest  her wife said, sitting in one of the armchairs.
- Maybe youre right.
- Im going for a walk, I have to move  Heni stood up from the another armchair and looked in the bus schedule, than went into Laurences neighborhood. She walked in front of the house, than looked at the local cloth shops storefronts by curiousity about whats the trend here now, she saw only see American movies when the current fashion already past. But now she didnt get know too much. The fashion was the same as in Hungary.
	Heni also walked in front of Laurence s house whe she was going back. After she arrived back to the hotel, she was reading Bible, and, after, dinner, she practiced the dance.

7

	Next morning, the family went to a local library, to look at what there was a library like, and, at half past four, Heni went to Laurences house again, referint to moving. Someone cam out from behind the fence.
- My housekeeper havent tell me for a while that you have been at our house but now she set to be suspicious fo something because she sees you every day since then that you walk in front of okur house. What do you want from me?  Heni set feeling giddy and her heart was violently beating, she was dizzy and feeling like she is going to faint immediately, and water was flowing from her palms. Oh my God, this is really him?!!! This is really him!!! Personally!!! The same attractive eyes, the same desirable lips, the same many, wide and muscular shoulders, the same muscular arms, and how tall he is! He was wearing a yellow T-shirt with white shorts what stressed his brown skin she loved like everything on him. She didnt even listen to what the man she loved, said to her who she has loved for a long time ago.
		She was standing in front of the fence in a state of shock for more seconds what she was feeling hours, than went back to the hotel. She stopped at the door for more seconds and she was watching to in front of herself.
- Whats up Heni, people gave you a lot of sedative?  Eliza asked.
- No, I just reflected  and she went into her room. She lied down on her stomach, on the bed and she couldnt think about anythink for more minutes, only about that incredible experience what happened today, then she was reading the Bible, practiced the dance after dinner, then she was readint hthe novel.
		After she went to bed, she could fall asleep only after hours because couldnt decide if should she go to Laurences house tomorrow too, or not. And after she decided to go, she couldnt sleep by the excitement. What to tell him? And will her knowledge of English language be enoguh?

 Heni took her long, green, slim skirt up with her top what was half-sided, with waves on its bottom and stressed her breasts, and her usual purse and sandals, and she was struggling with her make-up so much like never yet. She took her beautiful, shining necklace, her green shining bracelet and her metal earrings what had two streached triangles on these.
 These were pretty, with sexy, with elegant. Laurence isnt going to think shes just an immature fan.
 She went there at half past four as usual. Her legs were trembling and she has never been so excited like then. She was approaching the house so slowly that it was striking. Water was flowing from her plams again and her heart was wildly beating. She stopped in front of the fence and was trying to encourage herself to dont go back to the hotel.
 She was standing there for minutes and was already hoping he wont come out trough the gate.
- Hi. You came there again, I see  Heni was petrified and she didnt even dare to look at the man. He just was standing in front of her, after six years, now twice personally! She was trying to divert her attantion what he was saying. What a manly voice he has! Just like in his movies! He was wearing the blue, checkered shirt what she has seen him in it on more photos she had got from the internet, and long, white pants with sneakers  Sorry about my yesterdays behaviour. No wonder that you didnt even answer me. I just go know freshly the new that someone comes to my house every day and I havent got to it. Its not a little thing what my housekeeper said, that you would look at every tall-fenced house to know if I live there or not  he began to smile with this manly smile, what everybody knew  Youre surely a big fan of me. S o I thought about most of my fans dont do anything like this so I will favour you and we could be friends  Heni felt like she is going to be faint right away because she could see his attractive smile in live and because of what he said to her  You nor even say anything now?  Heni began to smile too.
- OK  Heni blurted her first word out she said to th eman she loved.
- Where do you live?  maybe if hell get know that she lives on the other side of Earth, he is going to withdraw his offer.
- Isnt it a problem if very far?
- How far?
- In another country.
- I think not in Canada because your knowledge of English isnt too good. Or is your mother language French?
- No.
- Laurence, what are you doing with this little girl?  Gina was looking out of the gate.
- She is that girl who the housekeeper talked about  her husband answered.
- Oh, I understand - Gina meteorically ecamined the girl with her eyes, then went back into the house with suspicious face.
- So do you reveal me where do you live?  Heni took a deep breath and restrained herself to reveal it.
- In Hungary.
- Its in Central Europe, isnt it?
- Yes  Heni lowered her head.
- So Im pleased at I met you and regret that we cant be friends. I dont know if I ever have that big fan like you. Bye  Laurence desappeared behind the fence.
- Bye.
 Hen i was hurriedly running to the bus stop and was standing and watching there to in front of herself for minutes. After she arrived to the hotel, she went into her room, sh e was reading the Bible, and, after dinner, she was practicing the dance. She couldnt sleep by her thoughts at night. If she will be a famous dancer, is Laurence going to think about her the same if they didnt met today personally?

9

		Next day, after breakfast, Heni practiced the dance, then was reading the Bible, and at half pas four she was lifting her legs with liing on her stomach, during reading the novel. After gymnastic, she stopped reading because she couldnt concentrate on the novel by the yesturdays reminiscences.
		She went out to the others, to watch TV. Jakab was sitting on the sofa, with his laptop on his lap, his wife was sitting next to him, and Eliza was liing in the armchair.
- Havent you any idea where should we go today?  Jakab asked after some seconds, while he was still watching his laptop.
- We have to go for shopping  her wife said.
- OK, and after that?
- Isnt it enough now, Jakab?
- Anyway, you havent been in an American shop yet  Heni said.
- Heni, dont you want to go something new place?  Jakab asked -You are who wanted to come into New York.
- I want to, I just dont know where should we go. But its enough to me if I go to the shop with you and you say your opinions about it  Heni answered.
- OK, so were going to the shop, than we maybe will invent something  Jakab stood up and closed the laptop.
- Where is any shop here at all? Do you know that? Jakab?  her wife asked.
- Well, were surely going to find one not far away. Take your shoes up.
	The family found a shopping centre in then minutes where was a supermarket too. While they were going towards the shopping centre, Heni felt that somebody grabbed her arm and drawed her from the way, than she found herself in front of Laurence, in an alley where was a very little traffic and wasnt even going there anybody than. Oh my God, he touched me!  Heni thought. Laurence was wearing black sunglasses with a black T-shirt and grey-brown, long pants and Heni was wearing a black sleeveless top whats cut stressed the breasts and it had a pattern on its back, and she also was wearing a short denim skirt with the usual purse and sandals.
- I decided to we still can keep connection, I was thinking of you a lot and I feel more than friendship towards you since we have met. Well, do you want to be your much-loved stars girlfriend?  then he charmed Heni by his attractive smile. Heni was just standing motionless.
- I would like to be your girlfriend, if you didn t have wife  her knowledge of English was stuttering because she still was under this wonderful surprisess influence.
- And why only in this case?  Heni was astonished. This is what the man she loved would be???
- I live about Jehovahs witnesss tenet and our religion prohibits it  she didnt dare to say that thing that it would be also too immoral for her if she hadnt this religion.
- Im happy about this  he began to smile again  Yesturday we agreed with my wife on we will divorce, our marriage wasnt so good anyway and you also came and I was taken with you. I just didnt tell you before because I dont want to be an immature girls boyfriend. I see you arent like that  then he was smiling again. Heni has never been so happy like then.
- OK  Heni was smiling too  But only when you will be already divorced.
- There isnt any problem with this. Were going to file divorce today.
- So thats OK  then Laurence stooped and kissed the girls thin lips who didnt even reached his shoulder. Henis heart was even more violently beating and a delightful feeling permeated her heart and belly.
- I know a desolate place  they set walking with holding each orders hand  By the way, I dont even know your name yet  Laurence was smiling.
- Heni Kovcs.
- And how old are you?
- Im eighteen  she seemed to be sixteen for Laurence.
- I think you already know my all life from the internet  he was smiling again.
- Yes  Heni was smiling too.
- And for how long time have you been my fan?
- For six years.
- Wow, its such a long time.
- Yes.
		They arrived in the park. There were only trees everywhere, somewhere there were some concretes, they sat down to one of them.
- You came for a holiday with your family?  Laurence embraced the girls shoulders.
- Yeah.
- I saw them that you just were going somewhere with them. Arent they worriing about you?  in this m oment, Henis phone rang. She answered it with laughing.
- Hallo.
- Hi, Henike, where are you? You could tell us that youre going somewhere to take a look round. Do you find your way back to the hotel?
- I will call dad to come for me when Ill want to go.
- Well, OK. Bye.
- Bye  Heni took her mobile phone into her purse.
- Were they yor parents?  Laurence asked.
- Yeah.
- Are you so shy with wverybody?
- Im like that with everybody with the exception of my family, some relations and my best friend  Heni got to be serous. Her knowledge of English still was stuttering by the excitement.
- Anyd why?  Laurence got to be serious too.
- My parents were also like this for a while  then she decided to plan the sentences in English in her thoughts at first and tell it after it to dont stutter  Beside I was asthmatic till I was thirteen years old so I used to be in hospital a lot so I hardly used to be between people so I didnt use to be enough experience about how to talk to people so I say only what is surely OK.
- I understand  now he may break up with her because of this?  Heni was frightened  But it isnt problem. I like you even more that way  then he kissed her. Heni was feeling the mans strong armss embrace and she embraced his muscular shoulders by the desire while they were kissing. It was so wonderful like in her dreams. Just it was the reality no.
		Henis phone rang. She drawed away from the man, took her hands of his shoulders and answered it. Laurence still was embracing her with one of his arms and was stroking the girls arm.
- Hallo.
- Hi Heni, its me. Where are you?  she heard her mothers voice again.
- Why?
- We also would go there to take a look whats there.
- Thwre isnt anything special here.
- So what are you doing so long?
- You wouldnt believe it, anyway!  then she turned the phone off and took it back into her purse.
- Your parents?  Laurence asked.
- Yeah.
- Do you have to go?
- No.
- So what did they want?
- They wanted to come here.
- And what did you say?
- That there isnt anything special.
- They believe you went to take a look round in the neighbourhood?
- Yeah.
- Isnt it forbidden to you fo lie?  he began to smile.
- I didnt lie, just didnt tell the truth.
- I udnerstand.
- Hello FishE Who is that little girl?  a man appeared in front of them.
- Hello. She is my girlfriend, Heni  Laurence still was embracing her waist.
- Youre kidding!  the man was laughing. Then the sun set to shine to them i the dark park, and Heni noticed only now that this man was Tom Cruise  And what about Gina?  he bacame serious.
- Shes only my ex-wife. We agreed on we will file divorce today.
- What? And why?  Tom sat down next to Laurence.
- We have had enough of the many quarrel and Heni came too.
- How old are you?  he asked Heni.
- Im eighteen  Heni answered.
- Oh my God, your taste change a lot!  he said with laughing to his friend, while he was examining the girl with his eyes.
- And whats up with you?  Laurence diverted the conversation.
- Katy recovered of her depression and she also takes more care of Suri at last.
- Its good  Laurence answered.
- Are you also an actress?  Tom changed the subject.
- No  Heni answered.
- So a singer? Sorry about Im not recognizing you, maybe its because of the make-up.
- Im not a star  Heni blurted it out hard.
		Tom couldnt begin to speak for a while. His friend became a guy who starts relationships with simple girls? As an addition, immediately after his marriage was over after five years? Or did he cheat Gina with her before it?
- I understand  Tom answered in the end  And how did you meet?
- She has been my fan for a long time and found our house. The housekeeper noticed that since she found it, she walked in front of our house every day and she set to be suspicious of something so she told it me. Then I was who noticed her and we began talking.
- I see. OK? Im going. Bye.
- Bye  Laurence said.
- Bye  Heni said.
- I think you realized that the stars come here  Laurence said.
- Yes  Heni answered.
- Do you do it for me that you dont tell it anybody?
- Yes.
- By the way, who are your favourite stars beside me?
- My favourite singer is Shakira, amy favourite actress is Rachel McAdams.
- I think you know that Shakira lives i n Columbia but Rachel has a house here, in New York too.
- I know.
- Have you been at her house too?
- Yeah, but I only saw the fence and the bodyguard.
- I thought it  Laurence was smiling too.
- Im not even so big fan of them.
- Not so big fan of them than of me?  Laurence was smiling.
- Yeah.
- And why?  both of them were smiling, Heni turned her head away and was silent  Dont you tell me?
- Because I love you.
- What? Really?  he was even more smiling.
- Yeah.
- And for how long time?
- I love you more and more for six years.
- So my feeling isnt unrequited towards you  then he drawed the girl to himself, embraced and kissed her, and Heni ambraced his shoulders while they were kissing. This was even better than the first kiss because they both knew that they loved each order.
		Another phone ring broke the kissing. Heni hardly could restrain herself to draw away from the man and take her phone out of her purse. It was its alarm what was indicating that she had to have lunch because it was twelve oclock.
- I have to go  she turned towards Laurence.
- Ill take you back  they stood up from the bench and walked through the park with holding each orders hand, to the mans motorcycle  By the way, why do you have to go?  he asked during it.
- Im on a diet and I can have lunch only this time, and I have to weigh the food.
- So you can stop this because I think you are beautiful just the way you are  the man was smiling.
- I do it for five years and I would put on a lot of weight if I suddely began to eat freely because these five years have very famished me for eating  Heni was smiling too.
- I can believe it. Gina isnt so persistent. Her shape only interests her when she gets a role in a movie or series. She isnt always as thin as in these. You have better shape than hers when she doesnt work  Heni was even more smiling. They arrived to the motorcycle.
- Wich hotel are you in?  Laurence asked while they were getting on the motorcycle and took the crash helmet on. Heni answered and when the man got going the motorbike, she hanged on to his waist. She has sat on a motorcycle only once, when she was a little girl, when she was sitting behind one of her fathers brother and she was afraid then too. Now she was wondering how frighten and happiness was mixing in her  When will we meet again  the man asked when they arrived, and Heni got out the motorbike and took the crash helmet off.
- Is it OK tomorrow at half past four?
- Thats OK to me. Well, I will come for you. Will you give your phone number?  Heni gave it, then Laurence kissed the girl and said bye each order.
- Henike, where were you been so long?  her mother asked, immediately, when she stepped to the corridor of the hotel room.
- Well. its not too easy to tell it  she was smiling, then took her sandals off and went into the bathroom to comb.
- You have seen your love in live?  her mother followed her into the bathroom.
- Yeah.
- What?  Jakab went there too  And how was he looking? As in his movies?  he was smiling.
- Yes.
- Ouch, Henike, youre beside yourself with joy now because of this? You know that you have seen him in vain, there isnt going to be anything between you, anyway.
- But there is something already  Heni let it slip. She already finished combing but she didnt dare to turn towards her parents.
- Did you talk to each order?  Jakab was keeping smiling.
- Yes.
- You dared to approach him?  His wife was wondering.
- No.
- So how did you talk to each order? Turn towards us now!  Heni turned.
- He was who approached me.
- Why would he approach you? Isnt it possible that you just thought he was talking to you?  Heni already couldnt say anything to this. She decided to tell everything.
- The reason of I was alone a lot to sightseeing was that I rang every house what had tall fence becaouse stars probably live in houses like these. I asked the bodyguards and housekeepers who lives there and they told it me. I have seen one of Tom Cruises, Brad Pitts, Jennyifer Lopezs, Shannen Dohertys, Lindsay Lohans, Rachel McAdamss and Britney Spearss housess fence and bodyguard or housekeeper, then I found Laurences too, then I stopped searching  Heni took a big breath  I went in front of the house every day since then to Laurence notice me and to be friends, he also approached me once and said that his housekeeper told him that I went in front of their house every day, so he set to be suspicious of I wanted something from them And when I went there hard again next day, he said me we can be friends but when I told him that I live in Hungary, he didnt want it anymore. And today he accosted me on the street and told me he still wants to keep the connection with me because he doesent want me as a friend but he wants to be my boyfriend. But in spite of the fact that I live in Hungary!
- And you were with him since then till the end?
- Yes.
- And what were you doing?  she was frithtened.
- Mother, you know that I dont have sex with anybody before marriage! He didnt even know it but he still didnt want it right now!
- So?
- Well, we were talking and kissing.
- Oh my God! Henike, you want to marry this man?! He could be your father! And how will you meet when you live so far from each order?! And would you move here to him to the other side of Earth?! And also, hes married!  she was shouting.
- They already got divorced! By the way, who talked about marriage?
- But we only kiss with who we want to marry?
- By the way, yes!
- Youre not on your right mind, my little daughter! Jakab, talk to her!
- I have to have lunch.
		hile Heni was having lunch, Jakab talked to her wife.
- Pussycat, theyre still very in the beginning, why do you talk to her about marriage? Only then be scared when she really will talk about this.
- Jakab, you arent in that religion what we are in.
- Thats right. But we have to give them enough time to get know each order before anybody would talk about marriage.
- Years are necessary for this, and anything can happen till then.
- And if it wont happen anything? Dont you even think about this?
- Pussycat, we have to take care of it only then  her wife went into their bedroom.
- What happened?  Eliza came out of the living-room. She only heard that somebody slammed the door because of the loud TV. Jakab told it.
- Youre surely onl yjoking!  Eliza was smiling.
- You dont believe it?  Jakab was smiling too  Ask Heni about it!  but Eliza didnt even ask her and went back to watch TV.

		Heni was liing on her bed for minutes after lunch. She couldnt digest the things what happened to her today. After she considered enoguh, gathered strenght to reading Bible.
		After she finished it, she was considering if continue dancing or not. In the end, she began it only because of Laurence, to he get know her, but he already got know her, as an additon, they were rogether! In spite of this fact, she decided to continue it. She promised it the courses head, and by the way, she liked company dance, and its more sure that Laurence is going to stay with her if she will be famous because he wouldnt have to be ashamed of being with an unfamous girl. However, there was at least ten years till she could be famous
		But she continued it. She practiced dance today too. She couldnt give it up because she already has reached till where she was. She didnt only have to get him but keep him too.
		Heni didnt dare to come out of her room after practicing, to her mother dont raid her by her shouting or only by long and boring talking to her. She was liing on her bed and reading, and, since half past four, she was lifting her legs during these. She ventured out only for dinner, to the kitchen, but her mother fortunately was in her bedroom too.
- Eliza, do you know what happened today?  she asked during dinner.
- What? I think didnt hannep what father said.
- Why, what did he say?
- Its the same.
- Well, OK. Guess what happened!
- I think you have found a house with tall fence. Did I guess it?
- Well, I also found eight one.
- Ooh! Isnt it a big much? You went for sightseeing to search tall-yelled houses?
- Yeah.
- Heni, you aren t on your right mind! We came here by a lot of money, and you squander it for things like this!
- Why, y ou have gone for sightseeing much less than me!
- So what? And you have spended money unnecessarily for bus tickets!
- Also happened something. Will you guess it?
- You think  you have seen a famous person.
- I did have seen. Two one.
- Well, so theres even less possibility of they really were famous. Heni, you are already imagining things! And who did you see?
- Laurence and Tom Cruise. And I also talked to them.
- Of course!  she joked.
- Look out of the window tomorrow at half past four.
- Why, what is going to be then?
- Youll see  Heni was smiling.

10

		Heni hardly could fall asleep by the excitement but she compelled herself for she was worth to sleep to have a good rest because of tomorrow.
- Henike, when are you going to meet next?
- Today, at half past four. And you cant prevent me from this, you havent got the right to do this.
- OK, you can meet but if youll think about it some years later like now, when you will talk about marriage, Im going to intervene because you havent got you right mind to yourself.
- You can do what you want, what you can do is at most that you wont come to the wedding  or you try to persuade my friends to nor come to even more spoil the wedding, Heni added in her mind but didnt dare to say it to dont give her any idea.
- Well, youre going to spoil your own life, my little daughter, Im telling you in advance  Heni finished having breakfast and practised the dancing, then read the Bible. Later she went out to the living rom, to watch TV. She tank her mother didnT even tell her anything already, anyway.
- Eliza, now look out of thw window!  Heni reminded her sister hapily, than took her sandals on and went down in front of the hotel. She immediately noticed Laurence on his yellow motorcycle, in a black, seeveless T-shirt and dark blue jeans.
- Hi  Laurence said first.
- Hi  Heni said too.
- What a beautiful you are today too!  Heni was wearing a dark blue skirt, with a black, sleeveless to whats cut stressed the breasts, and the usual purse. The sun was brightly shining and she was hot by the excitement and the desire towards the man too. Eliza looked out of her rooms window and saw while a black man who was sitting on a motorcycle, kissed Heni, then Heni sat on it, behind him, embraced his waist and they went away.
		They stopped in front of a place of entertainment.
- I come here with my pals. If you want to get to know me more, you should get know this place  Laurence said while they got out of the motorcycle and took the crash helmet off  Dont be surprised if youll see some stars  he was smiling.
- Ok  Heni said. They went in with holding each orders hand. There was loud, rumbling music. There were some bar stools, and small, round and big, rectagle-shared tables behind of them. There were chairs around the round ones, and armhairs around the rectangle-shaped ones. There were some billiard tables and slot machines behind these.
- Do you like it?  the man asked.
- I like it  Heni said.
- Hello!  a man came there.
- Hello!  Laurence sait too.
- Who is she?  he looked at Heni.
- Shes Heni, my girlfriend.
- And Gina?
- We filed divorce yesterday.
- Lets sit down  they sat down  What do you want to drink?
- I wont dring nothing. You?  he looked at Heni, who now almost became kmellow by his eyes.
- Nor me  said Heni. The another man bought a beer for himself.
- He is one of my friends, he played in Once in the life. Have you seen that movie?
- Yeah. I also have it at home.
- And what do you think about that?
- I didnt understand tha movie so much, I rather watched only you in that. But I have read in one of your interviews why did you write and direct it, and play in it. You could need huge self-control to give using drugs up, and I like it in you.
- Sorry about I just came now, I had to queue  Laurences friend sat down too  So why did you get divorced?
- We quarreled a lot and also Heni came.
- I see. And how did you meet?
- On the street, by a chance.
- Wich movie did you play in? Or you still play only in theatre?  he looked at Heni.
- Im not actress.
- Or are you a singer?
- Im not famous person  Laurences friend couldnt speak for some seconds  So youre very lucky in being Fishs girlfriend.
- Wont we play billiards?  Laurence asked.
- I am for it  his friend answered.
- Heni?  Laurence directed his attractive eyes at Heni again.
- OK  Heni answered, and everybody of them stood up. Then Keanu Reeves appeared in front of them.
- Hello!  he said to everybody.
- Hello!  Laurence and his frend said.
- Were going to play billiards just now. Are y ou joining?  Laurence asked.
- Yeah. But could you tell me before it, who is this girl? Unfortunately I dont know her yet.
- Well, Ill ask for the accessories  Laurences other friend set to the bar counter.
- She is my girlfriend, Heni  Laurence answered.
- Are you serious?  Keanu was confusedly smiling  And what about Gina?
- We filed divorce yesterday.
- And you set acging now? Because I havent seen you in any movie and also you seem to be very young  Keanu began to speak after some seconds speechless dismay.
- Im not star  Heni said already now. Keanu was searching for words through seconds again.
- It sounds such an exciting. How did you meet?
- I got know that she was my very big fan so I offered her to be my friend but later it became to be more. Now can we go to play billiards already?  they stated towards the billiard tables without any words.
- Do you play billiards?  Laurence asked his girlfriend.
- Very rarely  Heni answered.
- So Ill teach you  then he kissed her  Well be together  he s aid to the others. Twho people were playing against two people. Laurence began it, and, how they suspected it, she shot more billiard balls into the holes with one shoot. As an addition, he shot into these three one. It was Keanus turn. He shot two balls with one shoot. Then it was Henis turn who didnt shoot into any hole. Laurences other friend shot one ball into it. Then Laurence shot four one, Keanu shot two one, Laurences other friend shot three balls.
- Ill teach you how to do it  Laurence put his hand on Henis, he was teaching her that way how to hold the billiard cue and hit the ball with it, but the girl hardly could pay attention what the man was teaching her, rather the mans big, strong hands touch holded her attention  Do you already understand?  it came into Henis head now that she had to pay attention what Laurence was explaining during it but it more interested her that she could see the eyes of the man she loved, from a short distance.
- I think I still have to practice it a lot  the girl said.
		They were playing more one and a half an hour, while Laurence and Heni won most often.
- I al ready have to go  Heni began to speak then.
- Why?  Laurence asked.
- I have to have dinner  Heni was smiling.
- And you can do it only at six  Laurence looked at his watch with smiling.
- Yeah.
- Its not a little thing what you do.
- Why?
- You always obey your diet  they were still smiling  Were going!  he said to the others, already seriously. Everybody said hello, then Laurence brought Heni back in front of the hotel, where he kissed her, and ardour was glowing with passion in her heart while they were kissing and felt her belly hot while they were embracing each order during it.
		After she went up into their hotel room and had dinner, went into hte living room to watch TV with Eliza. Their parents were in their room.
- Heni, who was that black man who you were kissing with?  T mea inquired with grinning.
- What do you think?  Heni was smiling too.
- How would I know him?
- Guess!
- Youve picked somebody up already here, in America too.
- Well, you already knew it till now too. By the way, its not the first time when you hear about him.
- But?
- Hes an actor.
- And whats his name?
- You dont even know him, I also know his all life only fron the internet.
- But how did you meet him?  her sister was shocked.
- Mother or father havent tell it you yet?
- But how would I know that it was true?  Eliza hated the human and didnt believe in people so much. But Heni was with somebody for the first time in her life who she loved too, and she was very happy.

Heni got up and took her white mini skirt and her dark brown top up what was binded at the back of her neck and a row of shinkng patterns designed its upside and there was a neckline whats shape was like a drop of water. Then went itno the batheroom with her mobile phonw, combed and put on make-up. She went into the kitchen, and brought her phone there too.
- Henike, why are you bringing your phone here?  her mother asked during having breackfast.
- We havent talked about when well meet next time. He can call me whenever.
- Anyway, youre going to see it in your phone if somebody called you  Eliza said.
- And what did you do yesterday?  their mother asked.
- He showd met that place where he go enjoy themself with his pals. We were talking and playing billiards there  Heni answered with daydreaming.
- And who are his plas?
- I have knwe till now that one of the Once in the life, and Keanu Reeves and Tom Cruise.
- You were tlaking with them?! And you didnt ask for autograph?!  Eliza was indignant.
- So what? I didnt ask nor Laurence for it  Heni was laughing.
- But, for me, you could ask for it!  Eliza didnt endure if she wasnt the person whos saying the last word once in the life.
- You think this was on my mind then?
		After having breakfast, Heni didnt dare begin anything because it would break it off if Laurence called her and talked to her. She sat down to watch TV in the living-room, between the others.
- We should go somewhere. Were here for the last day and we werent anywhere yesterday  Jakab began to speak while the laptop was on his lap. Heni felt like her heart was struck by lighting.
- Were going home tomorrow?!  she asked.
- As an addition, we also certified that we took for you three-day holiday of school.
- Oh my God, thats right!  Laurence was a distraciton for her, from everything nowadays, so much that she forgot it  But I cant go anywhere. Laurence can call me whenever to go somewhere  Heni was sitting in the armchair with be absorbed in thoughts and she didnt even realize that the family was talking it over during it where to go, nor that they went away. When will she meet Laurence next time? Maybe never?
		At twelve, she went to have lunch, with the phone in her hand, then went to read. Her phone was on the bed, next tho her. Then it came into her head that the laptop vacant, so she went out to the living-room and put the phone next to the computer. It didnt go out of her mind, nor for one minute, that Laurence still havent call her, and she set to despair.
		She stopped usint the internet at six oclock in the vening and went to have dinner, with her phone on the table in the kitchen. After she finished, the phone rang. Suddenly calm, then immediately excitement went through her.
- Hello.
- Hi, Henike, its me. Were going into the shop. Do you need anything?  she heard her mothers voice.
- No, I dont.
- Were going back soon. Well, hello.
- Hi  Heni desappointedly stood up from the chair. In this moment the phone set to ring again.
- Hello.
- Hi  this was Laurences voice! She also would identify that attractive, manly voice if he began to speak in Hungarian  Have you got enough time to meet today?
- Yeah.
- When should I go for you?
- Its also OK to me right now.
- OK, Im setting. Im going to be there in an hour.
		In the last ten minutes, Heni looked out her window in every minute. When it was already only five minutes till the one hour, her heart sinked. He arrived!  OH my God, I frogot to put on make-up again!  she got frightened, ran into the bathroom and fixed the black lines on her eyes and the lipstick on her lips, wrote it on a note that shes meeting Laurence, took her usual sandals and purse on and went down in front of the hotel.
- Hi  Heni said first.
- Hi  Laurence examined her with smiling  Youre more and more beautiful very day  then he kissed her, then Heni sat on the motorcycle, took the crach helmet on and they went away.
		Now where did we came  Heni was considering when she noticed that they sotpped in front of Laurences house  What can be so close to his house?  they got off the motorcycle, took the crach helmet off and went in through the tall fence, while they were holidng each orders hand. Heni got frightened.
- I think y oure curious what like house I live ine  Laurence was smiling. Heni calmed down. So they came here because of just this. A huge garde unfoded before her with perfectly short-lopped grass and a h uge swimming pool and a huge, beautiful, orange house and there was a white plastic table with similar chairs on its terrace. The houses entrance door wad dark brown and there was a semicircular window on it. The living-room was huge, a white carpet was in the middle of it and light blue floor was round it, the walls was the same coloured but even more lighter, and there was a green flower in every corner. The sofa was dark blue, the armchairs was similar, a huge TV was in front of them, and there were light brown shelves in the both side of it. On that wall what was to the left from the entrance, and in frontof it and in front of the entrance, there was a window what looked out on the garden, and there was a light blue curtain on these. A huge, golden chandler was hanging from the ceiling, with a lot of snow-white bulbs on it. Three snow-white door was there and a stairs was leading to the upstairs, and it was in front of the entrance. They went upstairs where was also three doors. They went through one of them. A huge double bed was receiving them, with a snow-white edside table on the both side of it and there was a lapm on one of them, int the same colour, there was two dark brown wardrobes beside the door, and there were two green plants next to them.
		Heni was overscome by frighten again. Why did they came in exactly here? They sat down on the bed, there was a still life describing some fruits. Laurence kissed her, they were kissing long time, the man was stroking the girls hair during it, and Heni ambraced his shoulders. Then the man layed the girl down to the bed, bended over her and they continued it that way. In the course of time, he began stroking her breasts, and Heni was stroking Laurences chest wile they were kissing. Later, the man began petting the girls neck.
- I have didnt tell you something yet  Heni began tos peak during it.
- What?  Laurence was surprised.
- I dont want to have sex with anybody before marriage.
- Because of your religion?  Laurence sat up.
- Yeah  Heni also sat up. She didnt dare to tell him that she also would think that immoral if she wasnt be in this religiion.
- OK.
- By the way, were going to go ack home to Hungary tomorrow, in the morning  Heni began to speak after some seconds of silent.
- At what time?
- I dont know yet. Ill call you  further speechless seconds came  Will you come to the plane station?
- Ill be there.
- I have to go now  Laurence took the girl back in front of the hotel, where they separated after a long, passionate kissing and embrace.
- Henike, where were you at such a time?  the girls mother asked as soon as she stepped into the hotel rooms corridor.
- I wrote it to a slip  she was taking her sandals off.
- I now but where wer you?
- He showed me his house inside too.
- And what were you doding there?  frighten sounded in her voice.
- Well
- Tell me now!  she went closer to her daughter and whispered  Did you have sex?
- Certainly not!
- Well, thats OK. But dont go there anymore. If someone will see you there, is going to believe you go there to do that.
-OK.
		Heni herdly dare to fall asleep because she knew that when shell wake up, that day this beautiful dream  is going to come to an end because she is going to travel back to Hungary. Anf when she made up her mind to fall asleep, it came into her head that Laurence my break with her if they are going to meet too rarely, and this didnT let her seep. In the end, she restrained herself again and fell asleep to dont stay with having rings round her eyes in the reminiscence of the man she loved.

- At what time are we going to go?  Heni was moning aout from her room, in an orange T-shirt what let her shoulders being visible between the seelves and straps, and in a short skirt.
- Were going a half an hour later  her father said when Heni was already combing in the bathroom. Surtanly she terrifically got frithtened. Laurence maybe wont arrive in time?
- And when  is going to the plane start?
- One and a half ah nour later  Heni became a bit calmer - Are you ready girls, have you finished packing everything?
- Yes. We can go  his wife answered. Everybody took two bags in their hands and set to the bus shelter. They were waiting twenty minutes there. Heni took her phone out, found Laurences number and called him.
- Who are you calling?  her mother answered.
- Laurence  her daughter answered, when Laurence has didnt answer it yet.
- Hi. When are you going?  the man began to speak.
- The plane is going to start one and half an hour later.
- OK. Ill be there half an hour later. Anyway, I would like to meet your family  this means, their relatiohsip is serious for him  Heni was rejoicing inside.
- OK  they finished the conversation.
- Hes coming to the plane station?  her mother asked frightened.
- Yes. Why?
- And he is going to meet me?
- He said he would like to meet you.
- Really?  one of the parents asked with the oter. Jakab was smiling.
		After the bus arrived, they travelled through half an hour, then they went further on foot. Laurence arrived with wearing sunglasses, a yello T-shirt and light blue jeans. There still stayed some doubt till then in Eliza that maybe her sister just joked, but when she saw the actor close to them, she already believed her eyes. Jakab, his wife and Eliza shaked hansd with the man and introduced themselves.
- How old are you?  he gived Eliza a smile.
- Im fifteen  the girl was smiling too.
- Youre also nice like your older sister  Heni felt jealousy but she didnT show it. Eliza was even more smiling and turned her head away  Whats your occupation?  he asked the  parents.
- Im a managing director at the Opel dealres, in  Budapest. My wife doesenT have any job  Jakab answered.
- And wich city do you live in?
- In Tatabnya.
- I dont know that city.
- It isnt a famous city.
- Ask him about what does he would like from Heni!  her wife said.
- My wifes asking what do you would like from Heni  Jakab said.
- Were only dating for the time being, then it is going to come out -  Jakab translated it fo rhis wife.
- I see.
- Ask him about if he loves her!  his wife asked for it.
- Do you love our daughter?
- Yes.
- And when did you got divorced from your wife.
- Four days ago.
- Because of Heni? 
- Partly because of her too, and our marriage wasnt good anyway. Heni has said she wants to be Jehovahs witness. Are you that too?
- Only my wife, and the girls also learn it.
- And what this religion involve?
- They dont have any holiday with the exception of engagement, wedding, wedding anniversary and graduation ceremony, they obey the rules what the other christial religions also obey, they go to Reign halll every Sunday, they dont eat, nor accept blood and they go to preach a sermon.
- I see. What the irls learn beside they acquire they religions tenets?
- Heni learns typing and world processing in a training trade school, then she would like to go to grammar school, and she goes to company dance course. Eliza learns high rated English in a trade school. Have you get any new role what you havent shot?
- Not for the time being but they can call me whenever.
- And how long time is it to getting ready for a role?
- It depends on how much I play in the movie and if we have to memorize script or we have to practise action scene too.
- How was it long to practise The Matrixs different parts?
- It was very hard work for everybody to memorize our scripts and also to do the action scenes, in every part of it.
- And are you tehre at all filming of that movies where you get a little role, like in the Mission Impossible 3, or do you go only to your roles shooting?
- I dont have to be there at all of the filming of course, but I already have loved the first two parts of this movie too so I stayed there and looked the filming. Anyway, were friends with  Tom Cruise since we were children so we could spend the rests together too.
- What way do you would like to keep connection whit Heni?
- I can go to Hungary whenever when I have enough time, or I can go with her somewhere else, and I can receive her whenever too. Beside of them, we can keep connection by telephone too.
- And how often would you come?
- We could meet o n ly on weekends because Heni has to go to school and I think she has to study a lot after school too, but I cant go on every weekends because it would be hard to do it that way to people dinT realize that I go there sistematically. But I can go in fall, winter, spring and summer holidays.
- Do you think this relationship could be lasting if you will meet so rarely.
- It is going to be surely enough long to get know each order decently, then it will come to an end or well move in together.
- So is it a serious relationship for oyu?
- Yes, I would like if it would be swrious in the future.
- Dad, that much talking is enough, I would like to be with him the two of us together till well start!  Heni interrupted.
- OK, go for a walk, theres still twenty minutes till starting  Jakab said.
- We have twenty minutes. Will we go for a walk?  the girl turned towards the man she loved.
- OK  they were holding each orders hand while set  Lets go to the park  he said when tey arrived at Laurences motorcycle. They sat to it, took the safe hemet on and arrived there five minutes later.
- How often do you come here?  Heni asked.
- Always when we dont go to play billiards or to each order with my pals, beside some places where people already got to stars presence so they mainly let us alone but sometimes a place like these is too far, like now for example. It would be better if we had more time to spend together till you go away. I will really miss you  they sat down to a bench.
- I more and more missed you for six years.
- But we already can meet sometimes.
- Yes  the man lifted the girls had by holding her chin and they bugn kissing, and they were embrecing each order during it like they never want to let each order go. Later he took her on his lap, he was stroking her face, then they were kissing again, while he was stroking her long hair, then her arm, then her breasts, while Heni was embracing the shoulders of the man she loved. They spended their rest of time with this  I already have to go  Heni began to speak.
- OK  they walked back to the motorcycle while they were holding each orders hand and arrived back at the plane station five minutes later. Heni got out of the motorbike, took the safe hemet off, and Laurence kissed her one more time. The girl ran away, snatched two bags and got on the plane with the others.
		When they arrived in home, she went into her room and packed her clobbers like after every travel. Laurences movies invariably aligned on the shelves. It was unbelievebly queer feeling to see these DVDs ad video casattes that way that she already didnt have only these objects from the man but she became at least the girlfriend of the man she loved.

		Henis phone woke her up at six in the morning. She got up, panicly combed, put on make up, then did the room, then went out to the living-room, turned on the TV, weighed her breakfast, ate it and set to the school. Everything happened that way like before the travel, with the exception of she was happy. AFter she went home, weighed her lunch, ate it, then began studying. Then her phone set ringing. What Tamara could want on weekday? Or it would be Laurence?!
- Hallo.
- Hi  Laurence! Heni cheerfully lied down to her stomach on her bed  How did you travel?
- The journey was so long that it was already uncomfortable, and the bad thing was mostly that we had to separate.
- I miss you already now.
- I miss you too.
- Do y ou already know when the fall holiday is going to be? It would be better to know it in advance how to manage my matters.
- No, we havent written it into the rport book yet. Have you got any new role?
- No, but I can get one whenever and I also dont know how much script Ill have to memorize.
- I see. I love that oyu have so much persistence to memorize a lot of scripts, and also you surely have a good memory if you chosed this career. These things make you even mor manly  Heni was eulogizing with smiling.
- Wow, anybody havent said it yet!
- Nor Gina?
- She didnt really used to show or said anything about her love, we used to quarrel partly because of this too.
- I see.
- By the way, what are you doing now?

- Im thinking of you all the time.
- Really?  Heni laughed.
- You dont believe it? Ill show you when well meet  Laurence was smiling.
- And what do you do while you are thinking of me?
- I swim in the pool or be with my pals.
- Its good to you that you havent got any duty.
- Mybe it would be better if I had some duty. If something occupied me, I didnT miss you so much.
- Why dont you do the house work instead of the housekeeper?  the man was laughing.
- Ive never done anyhouse work, I dont even know how to do it. Im an actor since I was ten years old, I donT have enough time to this, and I nor do it when I dont get any work, anyway, there is some money to give to the housekeeper.
- I see  the girl was smiling  But I already have to continue studying now.
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.

- Hi, Im Heni  Heni was telephoning on Saturday afternoon, she was leaned against her desk and her legs was crossed.
- Hi.
- Can you come round today?
- Is it OK at about three oclock?
- OK. Bye.
- Bye.
Heni went back into Elizas room to continue her drawint what represented Laurence. Should she show her drawint to the man?  she was considering. While she was drawing and thinking of the subject who she was drawing, and this already made her happy, the intercom began ringing. She went down to the staircases lower floor to put Tamaras bike into the storage, and, after they went back, proceeded into Elizas room in the three of them.
- Tamara, have you heard yet what happened to Heni in America?  Eliza asked.
- NO, I havent. What happened?
- Heni is going to tell you if she wants to.
- The best thing happened to me what could happen  Tamara hasnt seen Heni to be so happy like then.
- Why, what happened? You became a couple to the Fishy?  the friend laughed.
- Yes!  Heni was laughing too.
- Really?  Tamara shouted and was laughing.
- Yes! You dont believe it?
- I dont know.
- I rang at eery house what had tall fence what I found, a lot of famous p eoples servants answered the door, and one of them was Laurences house. I told his housekeeper who answered the door, that I ring at every house like this and I search Laurence, she told me its Laurences house, and she told him what I said, so  Laurence offered me to be friends because he hasnt met so big fan of him like me, and later he fell in love with me and we set to be a couple when he already got diverced from Gina.
- I thought youre just joking.
- Its unbelievalbe, isnt it?
- Yes.
- You have a lot more chance to be your loves girlfriend then I had, and it also proves that you can become a couple with him too  Tamara was keeping silent  What let s to do?  Heni asked after some seconds of silent.
- Im voting to the bottle-spinning game and the folding game, the asking-board game, the Activity and my board game  Tamara answered.
- Im vogint to the usual ones. Eliza?
- Im voting to the bottle-spinning game and to Activity.
		The girls played Activity, then bottle spinning game, then Tamara went home. Heni was continuing the drawing. Her phone began ringing.
- Hallo.
- Hi  Laurence! It was yueer and exciting, seeing one of his photo with hearing his voice in her phone. She has seen his photo till now only when her love was unrequited towards the man  What are you doing now?
- Im drawing you  the girl was smiling.
- Really?  the man was smiling too.
- Ive already made a lot of drawing about you.
- You havenT even tell me till now. And what do you like on me mostly?
- I love everything on you, only I dont like nowadays when you have beard and mustache, but I liked these on you too before. And I used to like you more when you were thinner.
- And would you love me more if I was thinner?
- I dont know Maybe.
- By the way, I also realized it so I began to swim. At least, somebody sues the pool now, when Gina moved house.
- I see  some seconds of silent  What do you like on me?
- I love your beautiful hair, your lovely face,l your feminine personality, your little girlish sensitiveness and shyness. Because of these, it doesent matter that you arent thin, but if you were fat,it wasnt like this. There wasnt any quality in Gina, between these, in the exception of nive hair  Heni was smiling. She loved hearing these words by the man she loved.
- If I was fat, werent you love me?
- I dont now Mybe  the were laughing.

- And what are you going to do after this?
- Im going to swimming, then meeting my pals.
- How long do you swim a day?  she finished putting on make-up just now. She went into her room and set making the bed.
- Two hours. What duty you had altogether in summer.
- And do you like to swim?  they were still smiling.
- Its good because Im not bored and I dont think only about how much I miss you.
- I miss you too  Heni was smiling when looked up to the DVDs what had Laurences photos on these, and imagined how good would be with the man again  Dont you watch TV?
- I do it only when my pals dont have time to meet me and the others.
- What do you watch?  the girl finished making the bed and began getting dressed after choosed her clothes. It was strange and exciting, tlaking to the man when she was wearing only lingerie.
- Mostly adventure and gangster movies. You?
- I always watch your movies on TV when one of these is on TV, also if I already hve seen it and also if I already have it. But I mostly like romantic and desester films and sci-fi. But I watch serieses and quiz shows too  she finished getting dressed and pulled the shutter on her window  I have to go now yet.
- OK.
- Bye.
- Bye  Heni went to have a breackfast.
		Next day, in the evening, Heni went to have a dinner, her phone was in her hand. Why Laurence hasnt call her yet? Maybe he just will call her later. But why just later? What duty could he has? But isnt it the same when he will call her?
AFter dinner, she went to reading. Her phone was always  next to her, on her bed then, to look at its watch during it. But if also was there now if it wasnt her habit. Then she was watching the usual series on TV with her family, her phone was next to her, on the sofa. After the series finished, she brokught it also to the bathroom, when she went have a bath. Then sat to the sofa in the living-room, to write diary, with her phone next to her. She nor turned her phone off when she went to sleep, but she always turned it off at such a time. She didnt dare to get herself to sleep long time. She was afraid of the ring of the phone wont wake her up. In the end, she fell asleep.
		Next day it was the same, but she already was waiting the mans calling all day. Heni more and more despaired. What could happen? They used to telephone every day till then. Why didnt he call her then? Maybe there was no more subject? They couldnt talk about anything  she was trying to make herself calm dawn.
		The phone rang one week later. Heni was studying at her desk, where she originally kept it, and she answered it immediately.
- Hallo.
- Hi  Laurence!
- Hi.
- I think you were already waiting fo rmy calling because we havent talk to each order for more than a week.
- Yeah.
- My pals told about our relationship to other people too. Its only a mtter of minutes till the press  is going to get know that I met an eighteen-year-old Hungarian girl already on the day of our divorce and were together till then too. The reason of I havenT call you, was that I havenT can decide what should be do with us. Also, it isnt too good that we meet so rarely. I cant do it that way  the girls heart beat stopped, than her eyes became to be tearful. She couldnt say anything to this. He threw her only because of others opinion and the distance, while she waited for him through six years, in much more hopeless circumstances. She turned her phone off without any word. She was forcing to concentrate to studying, while her tears were flowing on her face. It was odd, when she used to be in even more hopeless situation, she used to feel the same, but without tears.
		She finished studying in the evening. She did the dance-practicing. Maybe shell earn enough moey with the dance to move to America, and shell have more chance to theyll become a couple again. Hhowever, probably he will have a new wife then. But maybe hell get divorced from her too. Maybe any woman wasnt enough good for him?

- Henike, whats your problem nowadays?  Henis mother began to speak on week later, while sitting next to ner on the sofa and watching TV.
- Why?  the girl was watching to in front of herself. Heni didnt dare to tell it her. If she told her, her mother won. She suspected it in advance that this is going to happen. She has knew they werent fit.
- You used to be so happy till now, and you seem to be so sad now.
- So what?
- Dont you tell me?
- Why was it good if I told you?
- Because it interests me because Im your mother and I would like to know it  some seconds of silent  Youve split up?
- It seems like others opinion is more important for him than his love!  she bursted into tell it and her all face was swimming in tears  Of course, I waited for him through six years, in much worse circumstances! And dont say me that you told it in advance because I know that you wanted to say this! But everything worked out so well how I didnt think it!How could I know this?!
- Ouch, Henike, it protected you from disappointment if you didnt even become his girlfriend. I know how it feels like, I also was like you when splited up Feri who Ive talk about you  she embraced her daughter. Heni stood up without any word and went into her room to reading, then did the house work, then practiced the dance.
		The girls grief nor has subsided when there was getting for on the autumn holiday. Like many people used to say, she used to rarely smile before their relationship, but after theyve split up, she has never smiled. Her days were usual, according to that agenda, how they usually went, but happiness left her life. But when she practiced the dance or was on the course, she had to force mood to herself to dancing, to be good in it. But also because of exactly the man.
		Henis grandmother surely has heard of the relationship and the break, but she nor has talked to Heni anything about this. Surely her mother asked for it. The girl didnT even want to call her friend. It was even more grievous to tell someone about the break than she didnt talk about it because pity even more fixed the loss. But she nor wanted to meet her if she isnt going to tell her. One of the reason was that Eliza would maybe tell her, the other reason was that Tamara would think everythings all right what would also disturb her, what would be grievous. Henis mind was on it at one at night, when her phone set ringing. How could she froget to turn it off? Maybe because she couldnt think of only Laurence, what distracted her attention from a lot of things. She looked at by curiosity who was calling her at such a time. Its not possible! Maybe she wrote the mans name to another ones number? And why hasnt she delete it at all? She answered the telepone.
- Hallo  she began to speak carefully.
- Hi  oh my God, its really him! What could he still want from her?
- Hi  she said shyly.
- In the past weeks I realized I love you much more than others opinion and distance how much interest me. I didnt think Ill fall in love with someone after Gina too and I dont think I will love somebody more than how I love you. I have been in love many times but I havent love anybody so much like Gina, then you come, who gave hr place. Do you still want to continue this relationship?  suddenly calm, then happiness passed through Heni.
- Yes.
- Im happy about this. I promise you anything wont come between us anymore, at least because of me.
- OK  Heni was smiling for the first time for some weeks.

17

- Hallo  Heni answered the phone at eight in the evening.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- What are you doing now?
- I was just reading.

- From 27th of October to 5th of November.
- So it is going to begin one week later. Have you got any programme for then?
- Not yet. But if will be something family programme, Im going to miss it and spend all of my time with you.
- So thats OK. I thought about we could go to Hawaii two of us.
- OK, lets go!  the girl was rejoicing  But I havent got enough money to this  she became to be sas.
- Ill pay it. Im going to go for you to Budapest and were going to start from there by my private airplane.
- OK!
- Im going to arrive on Tuesday, ant one at night according to the time there. This is that time when there are the least people on the street, and you also could show me the city but we have to start at most at five to they dont notice me.
- OK. And how long are we going to stay in Hawaii?
- Im going to take you to Budapest on the fifth, also sometime at night, because of the same thing, and we can continue the sightseeing.
- OK.
- Youre so shy again. It seems like you greew unused to our talkings.
- Yeah. This some weeks was already too much for me without you.
- Me too. But I want to even more show you how much I love you because I missed you so much.
- I missed you too. Im looking forward to meet you. I have to go already now. Bye.
- Bye.
Heni went to have a bath, and, after came out of the bathroom and made the bed, she immediately told the new to the family instead of writing diary.
- Dad, will you take me to Budapest, next week, to one at night?
- Why, what is going to be then?  Jakab was only watching his laptop what was in front of him, while sitting at the living rooms table.
- Laurence  is going to come for me and take mo to Hawaii, and look round in the city with me before it.
- What? And when are you going to come home?  he immediately looked at her daughter instead of his computer.
- On the fifth, the fall holiday  is going to come to an end then.
- Henike, are you sure youre ready for this?  her mother began to speak  Youre going to go away to the other side of the Earth with a strange man?
- Laurence is not strange. Weve talked a lot on telephone and I also have met him in America.
- And what if youll lose your way somewhere?
- Ill call Laurence.
- Mom, let her alone now! Shes already adult!  Eliza began to speak too, who was sitting next to her mother.
- Mom, youve been to Germany too, buy the way, and, as an addition, you was a little child then and you were with strangers  Heni said.
- Thats right. Well, OK, go and have a good time! But dont only because of the man you love!  their mother was smiling.
- So dad, will you take me to Budapest?  the girl asked while was rejoicing.
- Now I have to get up at night because of this? Cant you go there alone, by train?  Jakab asked.
- Jakab, you would let her to rambling alone on the street at night? You think it would be a good accassion to she is going to travel alone by train?  his wife rebuked him.
- Well, OK, Ill take you there. But wh y will he come exactly at night?
- There is less possibility then to people are going to notice him.
- Yeah, I see. And hell pay you the journey? Because I dont want spend our rest money to this what we won on lottery.
- Hell pay it.
- Heni is going to go to Hawaii but we wont?!  Eliza was indignant  So he could pay also our journey!
- Well go somewhere else, Timike. Where would you like to go?  her mother was calming her down. Heni set writing her diary.
		Heni still talked to Laurence every day, by phone. On 27th, she went to sleep already at half past eight in the evening, and got up at eleven, with her father. The girl took her leopard-patterned top what had lace on its V-shaped neckline and was hanged on her nexk, and she took a mini skirt on.
- And what are you going to do in Budapest? Do you already know it?  Jakab asked in the car, during the journey to Budapest.
- I have no idea whats where there, as an addition, in the dark! Always you have been who has took us there till now! Wont you stay there to show him the city?
- It came into your head just now?
- I forgot to say it.
- And when are you going to starrt to Hawaii?
- At most at five.
- You want me to rambling there, in the city, instead of sleeping?
- So what to do?
- Well, OK? Ill stay there a bit, for example till three.
- But there is something too  some seconds of silent  He is going to take back me to Budapest on the fifth, at night, and we could continue sightseeing. Cant you come then too?  she asked, sounding shily.
- How long would it be?  her father asked after some seconds of silence.
- I dont know. How many time do you accept?
- Well, more two hours for example, OK?
- OK  Heni calmed down.
- My pleasure.
- Thought you  she was smiling.
		They arrived at the locale some minutes later. They got out of the car and noticed the private airplane. Henis heart was violently beating by the excitement and happiness too. Laurence got out of the plane, he was wearing a yellow T-shirt what stressed his brown skin, and jeans and sneakers, and after they said hello to each order, he kissed his girlfriend.
- You didnt tell me your fathers also coming.
- Everytime he has been who has took us here so I dont know alone what is where.
- I see.
- So lets go  Jakab said, and they set. He was who was showing every place according to name, and was attaching sentences to all of them. The girl already set feeling herself unnecessary. Like she wasnt even there, in the exceptiion of they were holding each orders hand.
- What do you think, what the city like?  Heni asked when Jakab already set to home, and they got on the private airplane.
- Its interesting that there are only little buildings. And also, New York is much noisier at night.
- At least, there was less possibility to they noticed you. By the way, there are less people on the street during the day too, than in New York. And, in Tatabnya, there is even less traffic.
- Im happy about youre not so shy anymore  he was smiling and kissed the girl  Are you sleepy  he asked an hor later.
- Yeah  Heni hardly could keeping her eyes opened.
- There is a bed in one of the rooms.
- OK  Laurence accompanied the girl, they went in, closed the door and layed down to the bed. They bagun kissing. Heni already wasnt sleepy at all. The girl embraced the mans shoulders, she was stroking his chest, and he was stroking her arm, then petting her neck, and stroking her legs and breasts. They were feelin glik ewould be on honeymoon. Some minutes later they fell asleep in each orders arms.
		Laurence woke Heni up by a kiss.
- We have arrived.
- How long were we sleeping?  the girl was smiling. It made her nervous that she was uncombed in the presence of her love. The man looked at the watch on his phone. It was one oclock at night according to Hawaiis time.
- Eight and a half an hours. How many hours do you sleep.
- About eight hours. You?
- Usually nine hours.
- What will the pilot do while we are going to be here?  Heni snatched her suitcase.
- I dont know, this is his business. Hes also staying in angother hotel or holiday home or going away and going to for us  he also snatched his suitcase. The girl loved seeing it when the mans muscles tightened. They were holding each orders hand while walkint to the near holiday home. It increased Henis happiness how beautiful house they rented. A huge holiday house was standing in the middle of nothing, it was blindingly white in the dark, it had glaringly by red roof and a small garden with perfectly mowed grass. In the garden, there was a banana-, an ananas- and a mango-tree. Heni identified only the banana and the ananas  How do you like it?  Laurence asked.
- Beautiful  the girl asnwered. The house set inside with a short white floor, orange wall and a decorative shaped coat stand, and orchids aligned in pots, along the wall. The door what looked out on the living-room, was arched on the top of it. In the living-room, there was light blue floor, a big, red carpet and light purple walls, a big, golden chandler hanged on the ceiling, with a lot of bulbs. Like in Laurences house, just this was smaller. The sofa was dark blue, with two armchairs on the two sides of this, what fitted to this, two light brown book shelves were in front of them, and a TV. In front of the entrance, on one side of the living room, there were an American kithcen with snow white cupboards, the top of these was light grey, and the tile was dark brown. On the other side, white stairs leaded to the upstairs, and it had wood banister. Two doors were there. There was the bathroom and the bedroom. So theyre going to sleep on one bed It is going to be interesting
		They carried their duds into the room, there were two dark blue wardrobes on the two sid of the door, these were black handles. In front of the door, there was a big, light blue double bed, with the same coloured pillows. On the two sides of the bed, there were two snow white bedside tables with golden handles, and two hibiscuses. Heni was enjoying delight while she was packing into one of the wardrobes, and Laurence into the other one, then they went to the bathroom. There was light blue floor with the same coloured tile, with a huge mirror, what was arched on the top of it, and it was above the washbasin, the cupboards were snow white, and also snow white handles were on these. There was a light blue toilet in front of the door, and, on this two sides, a shower and a light blue bath too. This was like a dream to the girl, that she came to that beautiful place like this, as an addition, with her love. The man already got to the nice places. He was rather happy about because he could be with his girlfriend.
		They packed into the cupboards. One of them into one of them, the other one into the otner one.
- Lets go somewhere right now, or lets rather having a rest?  the man was embracing the girls waist.
- We can go  the girl almost became mellow by she could seeing near the mans so attractive eyes she loved.
- Wasnt it uncomfortable to sleep in the plane?
- Not at all  Henis bed at home wasnt so comfortable like that one was in the plane.
- So get ready. Were going to Honolulu. Take a bathing costume too  the man left the bathroom, and the girl changed her clothes to her long top whats bottom was wavy and half-sided, and her long, red skirt with wavy bottom, got combed and put on make-up. Laurence took a black T-shirt with longl, white pants, black sunglasses and sneakers. They were holding each orders hand, got on the bus the man hired and they arrived three hours later.
		At four at down, it already very began becoming light. The many tall buildings was remindigng Heni of New York.
- Have you been in one of the tall buildings in New York  the man asked, after they got off the bus and arrived in the city.
- We went up in a building with the family what had fifty-sixty stories.
- Would you like to go up to an even taller one that that?
- I dont even know
- You have agoraphobia?
- Yeah. But, with you, I wou ld try it too  the girl was smiling.
- OK  the man was smiling too. They walked to the building what had huge height, and it was even taller than what they went up in New York in tha.
		While they were approaching the building, Heni already couldnt even see the top of it when she looked as tall as she could. They went into the staircase and got on the elevator. Laurence pushed that bottom what took them to the highest floor. Water was flowing from Henis palms and her heart was wildly beating. The elevator was drawing them up during so long time what seemed to be eternity. In the end, it stopped. She they arrived in the highest floor. The girl almost fainted. The door opened. Heni dried her hands to her clothes, and plucked up all of her courage to step out through the door. The man took her hand when tehy stepped to the window of the staircase and looked through it.
- Is it very scary?
- Sufficiently. How many floors does it have?
- One hundred. But it isnt so terrible, is it?
- Its not, with you.
- OK  the man kissed the girl who was trembling by the fear with by desire.
		Before they came down by the elevator, took a picture, than got on the bus, and when they got on, a palace appeared in front of them what had three storeys.
- This is the Kawaiha Church, the first christian palace. Lets go in?
- Lets go  the building looked nince and elegant from outside, but it was queer to Heni, to see this little building after her previous experience. But when they went in, the girls brath stopped by that beauty what unfolded before them. The building was full of beautiful and elegant designes, with queer furnishing, and, in the execption of the red chairs and tha piano, full of objects what she didnt even know what were these but she knew that they looked very nice. The man explained what were these.
- How do you like it?  Laurence asked.
- Nice and interesting.
		They got on the bus and walked to a building what had also three flooors, what had decorative shape, but that bricks what were rised from the wall, showed that it could be very old. Another building was belong to the building, what looked even more strange, because that offsated that it was old before it, that there was perfectly mowed grass in front of the building, the elegant benches, the strange but nice flowers and the modern and pretty sidewalk. Heni read the label: Bishop Museum.
- Lets look it?
- Yes  they went in. This building was also beautiful and elegant, she nor even know about the objects what were these, but the man explained it also then.
- What was it like?  he asked when they came out of it.
- Queer and beautiful  she was smiling  Is it characteristic of all Honolulu?
- Youll see  they got on a ship, and when they got off it, huge, dark purple, light pink, light and dark green bars and huge mountains appeared in front of us.
- It was centre of ananas and sugar cane plantations. There are the tallest rocks of the world -  Laurence said.
- How do you know these things?  Heni was wondering.
- I already have been to Hawaii and they, who were here with me, told me. Before this, I looked after that places I havent know.
- I see.
- Lets go up to one of the mountains?
- But wont we go on foot, will we?
- Well, it would be a bit long  the man was smiling.
- So thats OK. I dont like climb a mountain. Its too dirty and tiring.
- I donT even know when I have climb a mounten for the last time.
They went up to the mountain by bus.
- Now were even higher than in that building. Arent you having agoraphobie?  Laurence asked when they got off the bus.
- Just a little bit. Anyway, here, if whe fell down, we fell into the water, and we can swim  the girl was smililng.
- Thats right  the man was smilin gott  Is it also a nice and strange place?
- Yes.
- Are we taking any photos?  Laurence asked the driver of the rented bus for take some pictures about them in exhange for money, and he took some pictures, where the sea was visible behind them, and, on the other side, the many colourful bars, in one of the pictures, Laurence embraced the girls waist, and she embraced the mans shoulder, and, on an other one, they were kissing while embracing each order.
		They went down from the mountain by bus, and they didnt stop till the empty, sandy seaside. The jurney was a half and one hour.
- Theres bathing coustume on you too, isnt it?  the man was smiling, when they arrived.
- Yes, there is.
- So you can take it off. I mean, your clothes what are on it  they were smiling. Both of them were curiously waiting for seeing how the other one looked in this little of clothes. They took theri clothes off an took them into the bus. Heni was wearing a light blue bikini, whats upper part was tied to her necks back, and Laurence was wearing a dark blue swim shorts. They were smiling when they looked each orders body. Heni noticed that Laurence has lost some weitht and became even more muscular since they has met in New York.
- How well can you swim?  the man asked.
- Just a little bit. I think youre pro if you continuously swim throuth two hours  they set towards the ocean.
- Sometimes I dont do the two hours continuously, just continue it some hours later from its half part.
- I hardly can swim though some minutes  they began going on foot into the water. The girl pulled her shoulders up by the cold water.
- And what swimming kinds can you?
- Only the breast stroke. You?
- I can swim with breast stroke, backstroke and freestyle too  Heni loved that Laurence was so pro in everything. She needed a man who can teach her a lot of things. This made him even more manly.
		They began swimming.
- You would like swimming through two hours also today?
- Why not?
- So Ill mostly looking you and taking some pictures about you.
- About me?
- About you too.
- But aren t you going to take it to the internet? My body has been much better in swim shorts once.
- I adore you also that way.
- I also adore you that way so I also will take some pictures about you.
- And will you take them to the internet?
- If you will, will too.
- OK  they were smiling all time.
		Theni went out to the beach, combed in the bus and tided her make-up up, then took her camera out anf was sunbathing in tha sand. When she used to go to beach, she always used to take there one of the novels what she used to read then, till now but now she left it in Hugary because she knew she isnt going to be bored because she can be with the man she loved. The ma was enjoying delight the girls body when he was looking her from the water, who didnT notice it, just was taking some photos about the place, herself and Laurence. After the man also came out to the beach, he was already unconcealedly watching his girlfriend.
- I also have had much better body once  Heni was excusing.
- But I love you just the way you are  he sat next to her, kissed the girl, layed her down into the sand, and they were kissing this way. He was stroking her body, and she was embracing his neck.
- We should going now. The journey till the holiday house takes a half and one hour  Laurence began to speak.
- OK  they stoo dup from the sand. They already got dry so they took their clothes onto their bathing costume. With the help of the bus, they really arrived in the holiday house at half past eight in the evening.
- How did you feel  Laurence asked when they arrived and went upstairs while they were holding each orders hand.
- Very well.
- Me too because I could be with you  he kissed the girl  Whos having a bath or a shower first?
- Its the same to me.
- So go first.
- OK  Heni went to the bathroom and locked the door.
		She went out in a pink nightdress with straps and little, purple flower-attarns on it. This was the first time when the man saw her in a nightdress, and he liked it. The girl went downstairs, sat down to the sofa and turned the TV on. A movei jsut finished, then there were commercials but she didnt change the channel. She was curious about what like commercials were there in Hawaii. The n there was a mgazine programme. They were speaking about some stars further scandals, she already got to these from them, than
- Some photos has turned up about Laurence Fishburne and a sixteen-year-old girl while they were kising in New York. The photos made in early September  but they were still a couple then, crossed Henis mind. So she wasnt been the only girl in his life, he trifled with other teenagers too! As an addition, with someone who was even more youger than she, two years younger!
Heni turned the TV off, she was watching to in froknt of herself and tears were flowing on her face when Laurence came downstairs in pajamas. But it wasnt what was interesting Heni that she was just seeing in pajamas the man he love for the first time.
- What happened?  he sat down next to her. Heni didnt answer, jkust springed up and meteorically looked for her phonw. The man just was watching her startled.
- Hi, Im Heni.
- Hello. Why didnt you call us when you arrived?  Jakab asked.
- It didnt came into my head.
- And how have you felt?
- Dad, I want to go home!  sh said, sounding weepy.
- Why, what happened?
- Ill tell you at home.
- Well, so come home.
- But I dont want to go home with him!  maybe he raped her, it crossed her fathers mind.
- Ill tell you at home. How will I get to home?
- There isnt enough money on you to buy the ticket, is there?
- Theres not.
- So Ifll go for you and well come home together.
- When will you come?
- Well, I dont know, when tere  is going to be a plane for this. Wait a little bit, Il look for right this on the internet. A plane is going to start two hours later. Ill call you when Ill arrive.
- OK. Bye.
- Hello  Heni ran upstairs to the bedroom, got changed, packed her clobbers and was running towards the way out.
- Now where are you going?  Laurencea asked. There was no answer. The man leaned his muscular arm against the door and didnt let the girl go  Why dont you tell me what happened?
- You know too.
- What should I know?  the girl began desperately crying again.
- Let me out!  she beged for it. Laurence let her out. Anyway, he is going to can call her on phonw when she will dalm down.
		Heni found a cheap hotel after two hours and she could pay one night in it. It was a concrete building with four floors, the room was small, in the short corridor, there was light floor with white walls, a small bedroom was in front of it, also with light floor, with an orange arpet in the middle of it, with white walls and to beds what were pushed together, where there were hite pillows with white bedspread and sheet, and, next to these, there were two light brown, wood bedside tables. On one side of the corridor, a door looked out the kitchen, on the other sid, the other door looked out the bathroom. In the kitchen, there was light blue floor with dark brown, plastic cupborads, white tile and a little, light brown wood table, and three chairs were round it, with the same colour and from the same matter. In the bathroom, there was white floor with light grey tile, a washbasin, toilet and shower. She didnt pack anything out of her suitcase, just got changed to her nightdress, layed into the bed and fell asleep after an hour of sobbing.

18

		Heni woke up by her phones ring at nine in the morning. She didnt turn it off on purpose, to Jakab can call her. It was him. The girl told him the address of the hotel where she stayed, and her father arrived five hours later.
- Hi!
- Hi. Why did you carry a suitcase?
- You thought were going to start immediately, when I just arrived? I travelled and payed so much, and Im here so I would like to look around  he began packing his duds.
- And ho long will e stay?
- Well, a night. Then were going to start when  is going to be a next plane. Or do you want to go home alone?
- So Im staying one more night too.
- And dont you would like to tell me now what happened?
- Look around on the island when you would like to, before this. I would maybe take your mood from you.
- Well, OK. Is it certain that you wont come?
- Its certain.
- Then Im going to come sometime at night  Jakab left the hotel, and Heni packed her clobbers out, then used the internet on her fathers laptop to dont think aobut that terrible thing what Laurence did to her. But it didnt work because her phone set to ring and she unsuspectingly answered to it. It was surely her father.
- Hallo  but it wasnt he. But it was He. When she heard his voice, immediately turned the phone off. Some hours later she read Bible during a half and an hour because read Bible during a half and an ahour because it was left out yesterday, then she did gymnastics during a half an hour. Yesterday she already had some hours of moving by this much walk. When she was walking with that cheat.
She did a hour of dancing too. Maybe he wont ingore her when shell be a star too, and wont cheat her with other girls then. And he is going to surely become serious and isnt going to start any parallel relationships.
		Jakab arrived back at the hotel at nine oclock in the evening.
- Hello!
- Hi. What did you look?
- I look around in the neighbourhood too, but there wasnt any interesting thing, but there asnt any interesting thing, so I got on a bus, went to the beach, I swam there, later a got on a ship, but it was hell of an expensive. But I went to the other side and looked a round there. There isnt anything what is interesting, only strange plants what there arent in Hungary. But you surely already have seen these.
- Here really isnt any big sight but we went over into Honolulu and the journey is three hours from here, and everything is like in New York there, there are so tall buildings. We went into the first Christian palace in the world what was beautiful, and into a museum what was interesting, and went to the tallest sea rock in the world, and strange bars of plants could be seen from this. Everything was queer and beautiful. But - she said, sounding depressed, then she bursted in tears  I didnt should go there with him.
- I see. But why dont you want to tell why?
- Its so humiliating.
- Well, OK, youre going to speak to me when youll want to tell me  Jakab went to have a shower, and Heni set writing her diary. Then she had a shower too, they pulled the beds apart what were pushed together and went to sleep at half past ten.

		Heni woke up at nine in the morning, and carefully go tup to dont wake her father up. After she had a breackfast, Jakab got up too.
- So Im going to look at Honolulu because Im here  he said during breackfast.
- Are you going to go I nto the palace and into the museum too? Because theyre very expensive I think  his daughter answered, while she was using the internet on her fathers laptop.
- I don t know, Ill see how much expensive are these.
- And when are you going to come? And when are we going to start?
- I dont know, I think sometime in the evening. Ill look for right when a plane is going to start  when Jakab finished having breackfast, took khis laptop over from Heni  A plane  is going to start and were goingt oarrive at the plane station abokut in two hours, what means Im going to come at half past five at the latest. Is it OK?
- But when you came, you arrived from the plane station in five hours.
- Yes, because I was searching the hotel throught much time.
- OK  her father gived her a pack  So Im going, Im going to come sometime. Hello!
- Hi  Heni continued using internet, later read Bible, then did the dance-practicing, and did gymnastics after having lunch, then continued using the internet.
- Hello, Im back!  the hotel rooms door was opening at five in the afternoon.
- Where were you?  Heni looked at Jakab.
- I looked around the city, went into a museum, I dont know if it was that one what you said, and I looked at that palance only from outside but I took a picture of it.
- OK.
- Have you finished packing?
- Yeah. And you?
- I can pack fast. Give me the computer for a little bit please!  her father worked thorugh fifteen minutes on the laptop. Heni would reading during it but there was anything to read. She didnt know that she is going to need the novel she used to read so she didnt even take it to Hawaii. How could she know that dream what happened to her and the man who she loved,  is going to come to and end, and he isnt going to be her occupation? She was just sitting on her bed and was watching to in front of herself like a depressed, while was considering about this.
Her fater closed the top of his laptop. The girl got frightened by its sound and came back into the reality.
- You can egin talking your duds while Im packing  Jakab began to speak. Heni snatched her suit case, went down in front of the hotel and waited her father. Five miutes later he came in front of the hotel too, they got on a bus, then changed another one, then went on foot to the plain station. They waited for the plain through ten minutes.
When they arrived in home, said hello to Eliza and their mother, then went to sleep without taking care of the time. But the girl fell asleep only after fit of crying was tormenting her thorugh an hour.

20

		Heni woke up in the morning as the other ones. She tyed herself and her room up, went to the living-room, turned the TV on, had a breackfast, then used the computer, then read the Bible, then began the half an hour of house work.
- Henike, you could tell me already now that why did you came home  her mother began to speak during sitting on the sofa, when her daughter finished doing the house work and turn the TV off. Heni sat down to the sofa  Did he rape you?  she asked almost wishpering, after her daughter hasnt answer through seconds.
- No.
- So tell it now!
- He cheated me with a sixteen-year-old girl  she said in a low voice, and her tears began flowing.
- Ouch, Henike! And who knows with how many teenager daughter has he done it too!
- And I did should know it?
- These stars are like this, Henike. They donT take care about morals  the girl ran into her room, meteorically layed to her stomach on her bed, and was sobbing during some more minutes, then she was reading her novel. Later went to the living-room to doing gymnastics, then continued reading, and, aftar dinner, did the dance-practice, then continued reading.
After she went to sleep, Jakab and Eliza surely have heard of the reason of break. Henis thoughts didnt let her fall asleep through a hour after she went to sleep.

21

		Heni got up at nine in the morning, got combed, put on make-up, made the bed and made order in her room. She still hasnt turn her phone on to Laurence dont nag her. Went out to the living room, turned the TV on, wighed her breackfast in the kitchen, and sat down in front of the TV to eat it. They were telling the usual news about stars scandals, in turns. Heni was almost bored with it but there wasnt anything better on TV then. Suddenly stopped eating, her heart beat stopped, and already didnt matter anything else, she was just paying attention to the TV.
- Laurence Fishburnes realtionship with that sixteen-year-old girl, is doublespeak. We could have seen him playing this actor in The Matrix and the Mission Impossible 3. Gina Torres, his ex-wife confessed that she commissioned a picture designer on makint the photos, where the fourty-seven-year-old actor is kissing with the girl. She said the reason of she did it, was that she wanted to take vengeance on him for the left her and to cant stay together with her real girl-friend, an eighteen-year-old girl. But now, she repented her action because she realized her ex-husbands happiness is much more important, who she still loves  Heni turned the TV off, then was sitting in front of the TV through minutes and was considering about she herad.
Was it surely true? She didnT find any shady thing in the story. She happily ran into her room and called Laurence.
- Hi.
- Hi. I thing you heard of the new. I also got know it just the day before yesterday.
- Yeah. Im sorry about I believed it about you like this.
- In the end, you couldnt now that my ex-wife is quite capable of doing it. Im also surprised about this. I didnt now her thorugh twelve years to be like this.
- What will be now? The school is going to continue after tomorrow. Theres only the day of today and tomorrow of the holiday.
- Im going to tralvel to Budapest today, at dawn, and were going to spend the day tomorrow together.
- OK  they talked over that where and when theyre going to meet, then said goodbye. The girl immeadiately told the story her parents and Eliza. Jakab agreed to he is going to take her daughter to Budapest tomorrow, at down.
- It isnt nothing things how short time change in your relationship  Jakab began to speak in the car.
- Yeah  Heni answered some seconds later.
- And now youre going to spend all day with him in Budapest?
- I dont know I still havenT even think about this. He only said were meet there and can be there all they.
- So speak to me about when I have to go for oyu.
- Ok  the girl was smiling, then they got out of the car and her father went with her to Laurences private airplane. Jakab returned there, and Laurence got out of the plane. Heni was wearing a black three-quarter-sleeved T-shirt with waves on its sleeves and a big shining pattern on its chest, and dark blue jeans with tall, but flat shoes. There was her beautiful, silver necklace in her neck, her light blue plastic bracelet on her arm, and earrings in her ears, what consisted of three little, white jewels. Laurence was wearing a dark blue, long-sleeved T-shirt with light blue jeans and sneakers.
- Hi.
- Hi  the man kissed her girlfriend and set during holding each orders hand  Youre even more beautiful than I remembered.
- You look very well too  the girl was smiling  Where will we go?
- I have looked a place in a restaurant.
- But
- I k now, you rdiet. I thought about this too  the girl reflected. What could he think about.
- I know youre considering now about what I thought about. Youre going to get to know it. It is going to be  a surprise.
- OK  they were smiling and were walking further speechless. 
They arrived some minutes later. The restaurant was beautful and elegant with white walls and red brick on its roof. There were light blue walls inside, there was dark cloth on the talbes, the chairs back-rest consisted only of a golden, arched shaped pipe, their legs too, and their cushions were dark blue. When the girl looked around, she immediately noticed that some chairs were took someones seat. But they didnt have to get frightened because they werent strangers, but the mans friends: Tom Cruise, Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anna Moss and some actor who played in the movie named Once in the life. Laurences mother was sitting there beside them too. As soon as the girl noticed them, the man took a small, golden box out and opened it.
Heni and Laurence were still standing at the door.
- Will you marry me?  he asked the question. The girl felt giddy, then her eye began to shead tears by the happiness.
- Yes  the man kissed her, the others were clapping, and they began kissing.
- I ghank we could hold the engagement here and now  Laurence began to speak after they stopped it  Call on phone your family and who you also would like to call.
- OK  she went away from the door but she was still standing on the edge of the restaurant, and called her father.
- Hi, Im Heni.
- Hello! I have to go for you again? What happened happen to be now?  he played jokes on her.
- Yes, come, but just the opposite now  she was smiling.
- What do you mean?  he got surprised.
- Laurence became engaged to me and the engagement  is going to be now!  she was almost laughing for joy.
- What?!  some seconds of silent  But youre only joking, arent you?
- When do I joke?	
- Mom will be ticked off, you know it, dont you?
- She is going to get to this.
 - Well, OK, where the engagement going to be?  Heni told the address.
- Ah, land take my evening dress here!
- Ill say it to Mom. Well, bye!
- Bye  as soon as she finished the conversation, she called one of her grandmothers, then Tamara, then her other friend, then one of her cousins. The reason of she didnt call there others was that they lived very far from there. When she finished, turned towards Laurence. He introduced her to his friends and mother, and they set talking.
		One hour later Jakab arrived in suit, her wife and Eliza in evening dress. Heni almost laughed when she noticed that her mothers was wearing one of her evening dresses, that one that she gave to her mother and she hasnt even wear it since then. She stood up and went to her parents.
- Hi Henike! Im not going to say anything now, were going to talk it over at home  the woman forced smile, mostly when she noticed the stars who were sitting at the table.
- Did you take my evening dress here?
- I took it here, this is here, in my purse  she pointed to her purse  I couldnt put it to anywhere else.
- OK. Im taking ot on now  her mother went to the restroom with her, there she took the dress out of ther purse and gave it to Heni. The girl went into it and got changed. She let her other clothes in it. She couldnt put it to anywhere else. She came out in a long, purple evening dress what was hanged on her neck, what had a long-sleeved, shining bodice on it, I n the same colour. During this time, Laurence also got changed in the other restroom, to purple suit, orange shirt, with orange-purple striped tie and black shoes. They came out in the same time. They looked each order and sat down to talking with the others. Jakab and Eliza waqs already sitting there. And their mother, who didnt understand anything from the talking, she was only smiling. Her husband sometimes translated to her what the others said. One hour later Henis cousin also arrived with his family. The fifteen-year-old Tdor almost fainted buy seeing the stars and asked Jakab for translate what they were saying. He and Eliza lso asked for aoutograph some of them. One and a half an hour later Tamara came too, with her mother and Blanka. Tamara, when she sat down between the others, she was talking only with Heni, Eliza and Blanka, however, he could speak English, and Blanka exchanged a few words of some actors too. Heni hardly managed what way she met Laurence. Everybody took a picture about everybody.
- And when the wedding will be?  Laurences mother, Hattie asked.
- Im considering of on one of the Saturdays, after winter. March is also OK to me, and summer too. Its possible to organize it till March because its still October but there is going to be a bit cold then but not very cold. I think summer would be the best because of the weather  her son answered.
- And where will it be?  the girls father asked.
- Where is it OK for Heni. Im going to pay the journey these ones who couldnt come.
- I would like if it would be in New York. They already got to you and strangers isnt going to harass you so much  Hattie began to speak.
- OK, so it will be in New York.
- When I was sixteen years old, I already counted that I want to invite sixty guests to my wedding  Heni was smiling, some of them were laughing  But I think most of them cant pay the journey.
- OK, so there going to be sixty guests, Ill pay it to everybody if its necessary. I would like to invite only the family and my friends. By the way, I can pay the costs of the wedding  Jakab transleted it, and Henis relatives calmed down and were happy about it  What time the wedding should start? Is it going to be OK at one in the afternoon?
- It is going to be good I think  Heni answered.
- So at one in the afternoon. And in what like place?
- Isnt it a problem that I wouldnt like to marry in a church?  the girl began to be afraid.
- Its all the same to me where are we going to marry, Im not religious  Heni calmed down.
- And where should be the celebration before and after it?
- Its the same to me. I think the best place would be a restaurant.
- Thats OK. Ill look for the biggest and nicest restaurant in New York.
They were sitting and talking all day, and they were eating and drinking during it, what they wanted to, they went home just at then in the evening.
		There were waling about some people on the street still then. Laurence got changed to his everyday clothes, took his black sunglasses on, and he hurried to the private airplane with Heni, while they were holding each orders hand, then they were kissing long time before he went away.

22

		Henis phone woke her up at six. She got up, made her hair, put on make-up, made the bed and made order in her room, turned the TV on in the living-room, wighed her breadfast and ate it. She went to the school where her class mates were conducting themselves the same way how they usually did, with arent speaking to her, in the exception when they were quipping her because of her shyness. But this wasnt bothering the girl anymora. They arent going to look down on her when theyll get to know whos wife she got to be. But wha tmad eher even happier, was that she is going to marry the man who she loves.
		When she arrived in home, began studying. Her phone rang after ten minutes.
- Hallo.
- Hi.
- Hi. You arrived in home.
- Yeah.
- What the journey was like?
- Like its usual. It was boring, sitting on the plane without you through hours.
- Dont you talk with the pilot?
- I do but it was still boring that I was sitting on the plane through hours, as an addition, no t with you.
- I see  they were smiling.
- The reason of I called oyu is that I found a place what could be suitable to the wedding party. They think this is the nicest one in New York. Will it be OK.
- Good.
- And when should the wedding begin?
- I would like if it would take a long time so it would be good already at four in the afternoon.
- OK. Ill book the place and the registrar. The ceremony is going to be in the yard of the restaurant.
- It is going to be good!
- By the way, what are you doing now?
- I began studying.
- So Ill let you alone. Be clever! Bye!
- Bye!
		After studying, Heni told the news about the wedding to the family and she began to send the invitations to the guests, the witness and one of ther cousins, Vanda, who is going to be a bridesmaid with Eliza. During it, her mother was trying to talk her daughter out the all wedding, but she didnt listen to her of course.

23

-  And where will we live?  Heni asked in next month.
- Would you like to move to me, to New York?
- I would like, I loved your flat.
- Wouldnt it disturb you that you would rarely meet your family and friends there?
- It would be better to meet them often in the further too but we can keep connection on phone too, and we could also meet sometimes.
- So we have taked it over. Are you going to move in immediately after the wedding?
- Yes, if you would like.
- And at what time are you starting to New York tomorrow?
- In the morning.
- So take some of your clobbers already tomorrow and you can move in already after the wedding.
- OK.
- So youre going to enroll for a school here?
- Yes. I know that we dont need it at all materially to I work but if I had only primary school-qualifications, they disapproved of us. And, after training trade school, Im going to enroll for a grammar school.
- Thats OK.
- Im going now, Im choosing my brides dress. Bye!
- I know that youre going to be beautiful! Bye!  they cheerfully finished the conversation. She told her plans to the family about the future. Her mother broke down, Eliza and her father was surprised.
		Heni went to look for brides dress and bridesmaid dresses already that day, with Eliza. Her mother didnt want to take part in anything in connectioin with the wedding.
		Next day, the whole family got up at seven in the morning, to catch the plane. They arrived at their accommodation at two at night according to time in Nex York, and immediately went to sleep.
		Five months later, in the same hotel, Heni made order in the common room with Eliza, then got combed and put on make-up.
- My wedding  is going to be today!  she said to Eliza during having breackfast. Her sister was sitting in that room what was in front of the kitchen  Isnt it strange?
- Dont you should already getting ready for it?
- Were goint to arrive in the restaurant in a half an hour.
- And how much time is it when you are going to be ready?
- Im just taking my dress on and fixing my make-up. At most a half an hour.
- Good to you! I press my hair through an hour!
- And how much time is it going to be till youre going to be ready?
- At least one and half an hour.
- So you can begin it soon  Heni finished the breackfast. She stood up from the table and did the half an hour of dancing practice, then she was using the internet on her fahters laptop.
		Later she was skimming to her things she took from home. Shes surely going to need everything? She took there all of her nine diary she has written to the end till now, all of her love novels she has read, all of them as a keepsake, and her every clothes. She wanted to keep everything of them. She was looking into some of ther fiaries, and was smiling about how different her life was before she has met Laurence personally. After a half an hour of nostaliga, she took her brides dress on and fixed her make-up.
- What a beautiful you are in this dress!  her mother said when she came out of the bathroom. Heni got surprised. In the end, this was her own daughters wedding, even if her mother was against it.
- I choosed well?
- I think my dress nor was so nice like yours.
- Eliza also helped me in choosing.
- Is Eliza ready yet? We should start soon.
- Im ready, we can go as for me!  the younger girl shouted from the room.
- Jakab?  the mother asked, sounding excitedly.
- Im coming?  all of them gathered together in the lobby and went down in front of the hotel.
Laurence was waiting for them with a white limousine what a driver drived. The girl got on, next to the man, her sister and parents behind her. There were some people too who were taking some pictures about them. They arrived in front of the restaurant a half an hour later. People took some photos about them also there, but like they wouldnt even notice them, they went into the restaurant where they already couldnt see them. There was a tall, snow white yell around the restaurant, the top of the gate was arched, and it had a huge front yard with perfectly mowed grass. The buildings walls were also white, and it had huge windows what looked out on the front yard. In the restaurant, there were light blue walls and white table clothes. The chairs made of dark brown lacqued wood, and their cushions were red. The couple greted the relatives and friends, sat down to their place and were talking with them. During it, their rest of friends were continuously coming through a half an hour, they always stood up and greeted them then. After the half an hour past, everybody had lunch.
		After lunch, the guests sat out to the white chairs what were in the front yard. There was a way between them, what was lined by flowers, and there was the registrar in its end, she was standing behind a white talbe. Laurence was waiting for the bride in front of the table, in white suit and white tie. Heni set on the way with Jakab, for the traditional wedding music, in her brides dress what had two straps on the both sides, on above her shoulders, one under her shoulders, her decolletage was straight and its neckline didnt show a lot, on the top of the dress, there were very light grey, perpendicular lines till her waistc its skirt was wild and circular, and it was so long that her feet werent even visible beneath this, there were white rose-had imitations round on its bottom. The veil reached till her waist and there were little, white pearls on the top of this. Her hair was holded together to the side and was put forward, and a thin, short curle was hanging on the other side. The bunch in her hand consisted on white and pink roses. Eliza and Vanda were holding the dress train. They were wearing short, peach-coloured dress. A lot of flashes were glitter gleaming during it, and Heni was happily smiling. When she arrived at the end of the way, the bridesmaids sat down.
- The reason of we collected here, is to be witnesses of Laurences and Henis marriage service  - the registrar began it, and she continued it when a beautiful music began sounding  Now every sweat dream comes true what live in the ambush of the heart. Life and love are waiting for you with wide open arms, and it depends on only us if it will be nice. The tall sky can collapse upside, everything can fall in what are intact, one thing is important, that you love me, everything else is only a mere of nothing. You live an eternal life with me, the blue infinity is waiting for us, because destiny intends to be each orders who love conbines them  the music stopped and some silet seconds past  The bridegroom repeat first after me: I, Laurence John Fishburne, marry Henriatta Kovcs, I will be with her for better or worse, for health or illness, for abundance or poverty  Laurence repeated it  Now Im asking the bride for repeat it after me: I, Henrietta Kovcs accept Laurence Fishburne as my spouse, I will be with him for better or worse, for health or illnes, for abundance or poverty  Heni repeated it  Herebly I am pronouncing you man and wife. Draw the rings up to each orders finger  Eliza and Vanda brought the rings in two, little golden boxes, and the couple pulled these up to each orders finger  Im asking the bridegroom, the bride and the witnesses to outhenticate the marriage by their signature  Laurence signed it first, then Heni, then Tom Cruise, and, in the end, Tamara. Then the couple proceeded back on the way, and went into the restaurants roofed part with the other ones. Twho of them sliced the huge, white cake what had three stories, and consisted of smaller and smaller cylinders from its bottom to the top of it, and there was two marzipans what were white rose-imitations, and there were yellow rose-imitations round, on every story of this. After verybody ate from it who would like to, anyone couls ask the singers for any music number in the rest of the wedding, and everybody were dancing who wanted to. At eleven in the evening, there were beautiful fireworks in the front yard, then some of the guests went home. It was already three at night when everybody went home.
		Laurence took Heni back to the hotel with that white limo what they came by, to the girl take her clobber into her new house. Then they went home, but already into their new home. When they got out of the car in the garden of the house, they were holding each orders hand while was going into the house, where Heni upt her clobbers in the living-room. The man showed her the rest parts of the house what she still hasnt seen. One of the white doors looked to the kithcen, from the living-room, where was dark blue tile and the floor had the same colour, the cupboards were snow white, there was a big, light brown wood talbe, with same-coloured chairs around it, and the cushion was dakr blue on these. The table was covered with a light purple cloth. A big window looked out on the garden, and a snow-white, semi-transparent curtain on it. The secind white door looked out on that bathroom what was downstairs, what was also big, there was a big, dark green bath in front of the door, a shower next to this in the same colour, the toilet was between these, the washbasin was to the side from the door, on dark green cupboards, with two drawers on the two sides of it, two cupboards were under these, and a bigger cupboard was between these, and these had the same colour. There was a huge mirror above the washbasin, and to top of it was arched, and there was a big window in fron tof it whats curtain was light green. The tile and the floor were light green too. The ghird white door looked out on a spare room with light brown, shining floor, with a yellow carpet in the middle of this, with two-orange-covered beds, where were two orange pillowes what were leanded against the wall, there was a yellow bedside table between these, with two drawers and with a cabinet under these, and its handles had the same colour, and there was a flower on it, in a pot. To the side from the doorm, there was a light brown wood wardrobe with black handles, and another was in front of it what looked the same.
		Then they went upstairs. Behind one of the doors, there was the other bathroom where everything looked the same like what was downstairs, jus tit wasnt green but orange. The other room was small upstairs: there was only a black desk, there was a computer and a dark brown lamp on the desk. The desk looked the same like the cupboards in the bathrooms, just with golden handles, and there was nothing on the place of the big cabinet, just a black chair. There was white wallpaper on the walls, and a grey carpet covered the whole room.
		Heni loved the whole house but it made her even happier that she could live in that with the man she loved.
- You already know the bedroom  the man finished  I think it would be better if you went to have a bath or shower because its very late.
- Ok  the girl went downstairs to the living room, for her clobbers, carried these upstairs with the man, she had a bath upstairs, then got combed. She also put on make-up to everything to be perfect, then went out of the bathroom while her feet were trumbling, in that nightdress what she was wearing in Hawaii. She has never been so excited like then. She was eighteen years old but she still hasnt have sex with anybody and she was very afraid of it too. Laurence ha da shower too, in fthat bathroom what was downstairs, and came upstairs in his pajamas, exactly when Heni also finished.
		He took the girls hand, they went into the bedroom. They sat to the bed, the man initiated a kiss and they began kissing. He was feeling that the girl was trembling by the fear.
- Calm down, I know you havent been with anybody. I wont treat you like you would have had sex with more men  he said.
- OK  they continued kissing and the girl was trying to calm down. She succeed to be a bit calmer. While the man was embracing her waist, she was embracing his shoulders. Laurence was stroking the girls face, hair and arms, and she was stroking the mans chest. Some minutes later Laourence took the bottom of his pajama, he was stroking the girls breasts, and continued kissing that way. Further minutes later he took the nighdress off from the girl, and they continued it that way, what Heni got frightened from but she didnt show it. The man layed the girl down to the bed, bended over her and was petting her neck while he was stroking her legs. The las article of clothing came off of them about fifteen minutes later. They fell asleep just at six in the morning.

24

		At two in the afternoon, Laurence woke up and was smiling whil elookin gher wife who was sleeping. A minute later she also woke up and took her clothes on under the dwet.
- I didnt even know that youre so shy like this  the man was smiling. When they were making love, there was dark, and when they stripped, they were under the dwet, and the girl was still shy when it was daylight.
- I still havent got to it  she was smiling confusedly. Laurence also took his clothes on but Heni didnt look at him. She also fel tit too early to see him when hi was naked.
		They went downstairs, into the kitchen to have lunch. Heni felt relief because she already didnt have to do any house work anymore because the housekeeper is going to do everything instead of them.
- My parents and sister are going to start to home today, in the afternoon  Heni began to speak during having lunch.
- At what time?
- Two hours later. I should go to them  Laurence took the girl there by one of his cars and he also stayed there till her family set to the plane station. They were talking about their future, her mother was crying almost till the end because she isnt going to can see her older daughter so long, but forced smiling and also was happy about her daughter was happy.
		Heni talked to the family, her some relations and her friends every week on phone. Next week she enrolled for a near training trade school and for an advanced company dance course. Two months later she felt to be enough mature to be a mother so she agreed with Laurence on theyre going to undertake a child, and the girl became pregnant. She stopped being on a diet for nine months at last, and she was very surprised because she didnt put on more than ten kilos, and also she lost it after childbirth. The man observed that holidays what were forbidden according to Henis religion, and the girl didnt observed these holidays. They didnT have any quarrel with each order over this. Laurence didnt expect to Heni celebrate with him, nor the girl to the man refrain these. Henis mother was Henrietta too, and both of them were firstborn, so the girl planned it already a long time ago to give this name to her first girl too, and it came true. They brought their daughter up in a perfect and happy marriage.
